  abstract: >-
    We argue that the properties of status hierarchies, independent of the
    positions actors occupy within them, have important effects on the degree of
    inequality in material rewards generated by status processes. We first
    discuss how a focus on status hierarchies differs from, complements, and
    extends the traditional focus on individual-­level status positions. Drawing
    on a range of empirical case studies, we then identify three architectural
    features of status hierarchies—variations in their verticality, the clarity
    of their distinctions, and their rigidity—that affect the extent of
    inequality in the rewards received by the incumbents of high versus low
    status positions. We conclude by highlighting promising research questions
    and hypotheses that this macroscopic, status hierarchies approach raises.

  abstract: "Resumen\n\t\t\t\t\tEste artículo explora la breve pero intensa historia de la palabra terruco, un término coloquial que se usa como sustituto de terrorista. En particular, se intenta demostrar que el uso de terruco como un insulto, aunque en principio dirigido a los miembros de los grupos alzados en armas, contribuyó decisivamente, durante los años de la guerra sucia e incluso en tiempos más recientes, a estigmatizar a distintos sectores de la población peruana, incluyendo a defensores de derechos humanos, familiares de detenidos y otras víctimas de la violencia política, y personas de origen indígena en general. Su uso recurrente en sesiones de tortura y en episodios de violación sexual añade una dimensión adicional a la conexión entre el término terruco y la práctica generalizada de formas de abuso y violencia que fueron consideradas, por muchos peruanos, necesarias y hasta legítimas durante los años del conflicto armado interno\n\t\t\t\t,"

    Abstract
                While Big Data offers a potentially less expensive, less burdensome, and more timely alternative to survey data for producing a variety of statistics, it is not without error. The AAPOR Task Force on Big Data and others have called for researchers to evaluate the quality of Big Data using an approach similar to the total survey error (TSE) framework. However, differences in the construction of, access to, and overall data structure between survey data and Big Data make application of TSE difficult. In this article, we seek to develop the Total Error Framework (TEF), an extension of the TSE framework, to be (1) more inclusive and applicable to many types of Big Data, (2) comprehensive in that it considers “total” error, and (3) unified in that it allows researchers to compare errors in Big Data to errors in survey data. After outlining this framework, we then illustrate an application of TEF by comparing error in housing unit area (square footage) estimates collected in a survey (the 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey [RECS]) to those estimates found in three Big Data databases (Zillow.com, Acxiom, and CoreLogic).

    "Applied econometrics, known to aficionados as 'metrics, is the original
    data science. 'Metrics encompasses the statistical methods economists use to
    untangle cause and effect in human affairs. Through accessible discussion
    and with a dose of kung fu-themed humor, Mastering 'Metrics presents the
    essential tools of econometric research and demonstrates why econometrics is
    exciting and useful.The five most valuable econometric methods, or what the
    authors call the Furious Five--random assignment, regression, instrumental
    variables, regression discontinuity designs, and differences in
    differences--are illustrated through well-crafted real-world examples
    (vetted for awesomeness by Kung Fu Panda's Jade Palace). Does health
    insurance make you healthier? Randomized experiments provide answers. Are
    expensive private colleges and selective public high schools better than
    more pedestrian institutions? Regression analysis and a regression
    discontinuity design reveal the surprising truth. When private banks teeter,
    and depositors take their money and run, should central banks step in to
    save them? Differences-in-differences analysis of a Depression-era banking
    crisis offers a response. Could arresting O. J. Simpson have saved his
    ex-wife's life? Instrumental variables methods instruct law enforcement
    authorities in how best to respond to domestic abuse.Wielding econometric
    tools with skill and confidence, Mastering 'Metrics uses data and statistics
    to illuminate the path from cause to effect. Shows why econometrics is
    important Explains econometric research through humorous and accessible

    The academic study and the applied use of agent-based modelling of social
    processes has matured considerably over the last thirty years. The time is
    now right to engage seriously with the ethics and responsible practice of
    agent-based social simulation. In this paper, we first outline the many
    reasons why it is appropriate to explore an ethics of agent-based modelling
    and how ethical issues arise in its practice and organisation. We go on to
    discuss different approaches to standardisation as a way of supporting
    responsible practice. Some of the main conclusions are organised as
    provisions in a draft code of ethics. We intend for this draft to be further
    developed by the community before being adopted by individuals and groups
    within the field informally or formally.

  abstract: >-
    Regionalization is a classification procedure applied to spatial objects
    with an areal representation, which groups them into homogeneous contiguous
    regions. This paper presents an efficient method for regionalization. The
    first step creates a connectivity graph that captures the neighbourhood
    relationship between the spatial objects. The cost of each edge in the graph
    is inversely proportional to the similarity between the regions it joins. We
    summarize the neighbourhood structure by a minimum spanning tree (MST),
    which is a connected tree with no circuits. We partition the MST by
    successive removal of edges that link dissimilar regions. The result is the
    division of the spatial objects into connected regions that have maximum
    internal homogeneity. Since the MST partitioning problem is NP‐hard, we
    propose a heuristic to speed up the tree partitioning significantly. Our
    results show that our proposed method combines performance and quality, and
    it is a good alternative to other regionalization methods found in the
    literature.

  abstract: >-
    Traditionally economists have based their economic predictions on the
    assumption that humans are super-rational creatures, using the information
    we are given efficiently and generally making selfish decisions that work
    well for us as individuals. Economists also assume that we're doing the very
    best we can possibly do - not only for today, but over our whole lifetimes
    too. But increasingly the study of behavioural economics is revealing that
    our lives are not that simple. Instead, our decisions are complicated by our
    own psychology. Each of us makes mistakes every day. We don't always know
    what's best for us and, even if we do, we might not have the self-control to
    deliver on our best intentions. We struggle to stay on diets, to get enough
    exercise and to manage our money. We misjudge risky situations. We are prone
    to herding: sometimes peer pressure leads us blindly to copy others around
    us; other times copying others helps us to learn quickly about new,
    unfamiliar situations. 00This Very Short Introduction explores the reasons
    why we make irrational decisions; how we decide quickly; why we make
    mistakes in risky situations; our tendency to procrastination; and how we
    are affected by social influences, personality, mood and emotions

    Globalization makes cross-national encounters increasingly common. Hesitant
    cooperation across national, ethnic, and cultural boundaries, however,
    undercuts the microlevel stabilizers of global integration and, most
    importantly, the willingness to share with and place trust in members of
    other social groups. In a 109-country online experiment, we convey
    information on interaction partners’ nationalities to indicate membership in
    a broader in- or out-group, cultural distance, and perceived material
    neediness—or status differences more generally—to 1,674 participants in
    incentivized games of generosity (dictator game) and trust (trust game). We
    ﬁnd consistent evidence for in-group favoritism and—against this
    benchmark—demonstrate that individuals across the globe share more with but
    place less trust in interaction partners from poor countries and that
    cultural distance moderates this status effect.

    We estimated ideological preferences of 3.8 million Twitter users and, using
    a data set of nearly 150 million tweets concerning 12 political and
    nonpolitical issues, explored whether online communication resembles an
    “echo chamber” (as a result of selective exposure and ideological
    segregation) or a “national conversation.” We observed that information was
    exchanged primarily among individuals with similar ideological preferences
    in the case of political issues (e.g., 2012 presidential election, 2013
    government shutdown) but not many other current events (e.g., 2013 Boston
    Marathon bombing, 2014 Super Bowl). Discussion of the Newtown shootings in
    2012 reflected a dynamic process, beginning as a national conversation
    before transforming into a polarized exchange. With respect to both
    political and nonpolitical issues, liberals were more likely than
    conservatives to engage in cross-ideological dissemination; this is an
    important asymmetry with respect to the structure of communication that is
    consistent with psychological theory and research bearing on ideological
    differences in epistemic, existential, and relational motivation. Overall,
    we conclude that previous work may have overestimated the degree of
    ideological segregation in social-media usage.

    Guidelines for designing information charts often state that the
    presentation should reduce ‗chart junk‘ – visual embellishments that are not
    essential to understanding the data. In contrast, some popular chart
    designers wrap the presented data in detailed and elaborate imagery, raising
    the questions of whether this imagery is really as detrimental to
    understanding as has been proposed, and whether the visual embellishment may
    have other benefits. To investigate these issues, we conducted an experiment
    that compared embellished charts with plain ones, and measured both
    interpretation accuracy and long-term recall. We found that people‘s
    accuracy in describing the embellished charts was no worse than for plain
    charts, and that their recall after a two-to-three-week gap was
    significantly better. Although we are cautious about recommending that all
    charts be produced in this style, our results question some of the premises
    of the minimalist approach to chart design.

  abstract: >-
    In archaeological applications involving the spatial clustering of
    two-dimensional spatial data kmeans cluster analysis has proved to be a
    popular method for over 40 years. There are alternatives to k-means analysis
    which can be thought of as either ‘competitive’ or ‘complementary’ such as
    k-medoids, model-based clustering, fuzzy clustering and density based
    clustering among many possibilities. Most of these have been little used in
    archaeology. That k-means has been a method of choice is probably because it
    is readily understood, is perceived as being geared to archaeological needs,
    and was rendered accessible at a time when computational resources were
    limited compared to what is now available. It is, in fact, a
    long-established approach to clustering that pre-dates archaeological
    interest in it by some years. The theses of the present paper are that (a)
    other methods are available that potentially improve on what is possible
    with k-means; (b) these are (mostly) as readily understood as k-means; (c)
    they are now as easy to implement as k-means is; and (d) merit more
    attention than they have received from practitioners who ﬁnd k-means useful.
    The arguments are illustrated by extensive application to a data set that
    has been the subject of several previous studies.

    Cognitive interviewing has emerged as one of the more prominent methods for
    identifying and correcting problems with survey questions. We define
    cognitive interviewing as the administration of draft survey questions while
    collecting additional verbal information about the survey responses, which
    is used to evaluate the quality of the response or to help determine whether
    the question is generating the information that its author intends. But
    beyond this general categorization, cognitive interviewing potentially
    includes a variety of activities that may be based on different assumptions
    about the type of data that are being collected and the role of the
    interviewer in that process. This synthesis reviews the range of current
    cognitive interviewing practices, focusing on three considerations: (1) what
    are the dominant paradigms of cognitive interviewing—what is produced under
    each, and what are their apparent advantages; (2) what key decisions about
    cognitive interview study design need to be made once the general approach
    is selected (e.g., who should be interviewed, how many interviews should be
    conducted, and how should probes be selected), and what bases exist for
    making these decisions; and (3) how cognitive interviewing data should be
    evaluated, and what standards of evidence exist for making questionnaire
    design decisions based on study findings. In considering these issues, we
    highlight where standards for best practices are not clearly defined, and
    suggest broad areas worthy of additional methodological research.

    How can we best gauge the political opinions of the citizenry? Since their
    emergence in the 1930s, opinion polls—or surveys—have become the dominant
    way to assess the public will. But even given the long history of polling,
    there is no agreement among political scientists on how to best measure
    public opinion through polls. This article is a call for political
    scientists to be more self-conscious about the choices we make when we
    attempt to measure public opinion with surveys in two realms. I first take
    up the question of whom to interview, discussing the major challenges survey
    researchers face when sampling respondents from the population of interest.
    I then discuss the level of specificity with which we can properly collect
    information about the political preferences of individuals. I focus on the
    types of question wording and item aggregation strategies researchers can
    use to accurately measure public opinion.

    "This is an intro-level text that teaches how to think clearly and
    conceptually about quantitative information, emphasizing ideas over
    technicality and assuming no prior exposure to data analysis, statistics, or
    quantitative methods. The books four parts present the foundation for
    quantiative reasoning: correlation and causation; statistical relationships;
    causal phenomena; and incorporating quantitative information into decision
    making. Within these parts it covers the array of tools used by social
    scientists, including regression, inference, experiments, research design,
    and more, all by explaining the rationale and logic behind such tools rather
    than focusing only on the technical calculations used for each. New concepts
    are presented simply, with the help of copious examples, and the books leans
    towards graphic rather than mathematical representation of data, with any
    technical material included in appendices"--

    This article presents evidence that exposure to officer-involved deaths of
    low-threat Black victims increases political interest and voter turnout
    among Black respondents under age 40 to the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial
    Post-Election Survey. Victim race, threat level, and visibility affect the
    likelihood that an officer-involved death will mobilize political interest.
    Political interest and voter turnout are higher among the treatment group,
    which was exposed to high-visibility/low-threat Black victims only before
    participating in the CMPS, than in the control group, which was exposed to
    such victims only after taking the survey. Exposing young Black respondents
    to all victims without accounting for threat, visibility, or race does not
    affect political interest or voter turnout, suggesting the importance of
    these factors for mobilization. The findings clarify the role that Black
    Lives Matter activists, journalists, and watchdog groups can play in
    countering the police actions that shape the visibility and framing of Black
    victims of police violence.

    Abstract
                
                  Objectives
                  We test the effects of four policy scenarios on recruitment into organized crime. The policy scenarios target (i) organized crime leaders and (ii) facilitators for imprisonment, (iii) provide educational and welfare support to children and their mothers while separating them from organized-crime fathers, and (iv) increase educational and social support to at-risk schoolchildren.
                
                
                  Methods
                  We developed a novel agent-based model drawing on theories of peer effects (differential association, social learning), social embeddedness of organized crime, and the general theory of crime. Agents are simultaneously embedded in multiple social networks (household, kinship, school, work, friends, and co-offending) and possess heterogeneous individual attributes. Relational and individual attributes determine the probability of offending. Co-offending with organized crime members determines recruitment into the criminal group. All the main parameters are calibrated on data from Palermo or Sicily (Italy). We test the effect of the four policy scenarios against a baseline no-intervention scenario on the number of newly recruited and total organized crime members using Generalized Estimating Equations models.
                
                
                  Results
                  The simulations generate realistic outcomes, with relatively stable organized crime membership and crime rates. All simulated policy interventions reduce the total number of members, whereas all but primary socialization reduce newly recruited members. The intensity of the effects, however, varies across dependent variables and models.
                
                
                  Conclusions
                  Agent-based models effectively enable to develop theoretically driven and empirically calibrated simulations of organized crime. The simulations can fill the gaps in evaluation research in the field of organized crime and allow us to test different policies in different environmental contexts.

    Capturing dynamics of operational similarity among terrorist groups is
    critical to provide actionable insights for counter-terrorism and
    intelligence monitoring. Yet, in spite of its theoretical and practical
    relevance, research addressing this problem is currently lacking. We tackle
    this problem proposing a novel computational framework for detecting
    clusters of terrorist groups sharing similar behaviors, focusing on groups’
    yearly repertoire of deployed tactics, attacked targets, and utilized
    weapons. Specifically considering those organizations that have plotted at
    least 50 attacks from 1997 to 2018, accounting for a total of 105 groups
    responsible for more than 42,000 events worldwide, we offer three sets of
    results. First, we show that over the years global terrorism has been
    characterized by increasing operational cohesiveness. Second, we highlight
    that year-to-year stability in co-clustering among groups has been
    particularly high from 2009 to 2018, indicating temporal consistency of
    similarity patterns in the last decade. Third, we demonstrate that
    operational similarity between two organizations is driven by three factors:
    (a) their overall activity; (b) the difference in the diversity of their
    operational repertoires; (c) the difference in a combined measure of
    diversity and activity. Groups’ operational preferences, geographical
    homophily and ideological affinity have no consistent role in determining
    operational similarity.

    Background:
                  While clinical medicine has exploded, electronic health records for Natural Language Processing (NLP) analyses, public health, and health policy research have not yet adopted these algorithms. We aimed to dissect the health chapters of the government plans of the 2016 and 2021 Peruvian presidential elections, and to compare different NLP algorithms.
                
                
                  Methods:
                  From the government plans (18 in 2016; 19 in 2021) we extracted each sentence from the health chapters. We used five NLP algorithms to extract keywords and phrases from each plan: Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), TextRank, Keywords Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (KeyBERT), and Rapid Automatic Keywords Extraction (Rake).
                
                
                  Results:
                  In 2016 we analysed 630 sentences, whereas in 2021 there were 1,685 sentences. The TF-IDF algorithm showed that in 2016, 26 terms appeared with a frequency of 0.08 or greater, while in 2021 27 terms met this criterion. The LDA algorithm defined two groups. The first included terms related to things the population would receive (e.g., ’insurance’), while the second included terms about the health system (e.g., ’capacity’). In 2021, most of the government plans belonged to the second group. The TextRank analysis provided keywords showing that ’universal health coverage’ appeared frequently in 2016, while in 2021 keywords about the COVID-19 pandemic were often found. The KeyBERT algorithm provided keywords based on the context of the text. These keywords identified some underlying characteristics of the political party (e.g., political spectrum such as left-wing). The Rake algorithm delivered phrases, in which we found ’universal health coverage’ in 2016 and 2021.
                
                
                  Conclusion:
                  The NLP analysis could be used to inform on the underlying priorities in each government plan. NLP analysis could also be included in research of health policies and politics during general elections and provide informative summaries for the general population.

    This paper contributes to the ongoing discussions on the scholarly access to
    social media data, discussing a case where this access is barred despite its
    value for understanding and countering online disinformation and despite the
    absence of privacy or copyright issues. Our study concerns YouTube’s
    engagement metrics and, more speciﬁcally, the way in which the platform
    removes "fake views" (i.e., views considered as artiﬁcial or illegitimate by
    the platform). Working with one and a half year of data extracted from a
    thousand French YouTube channels, we show the massive extent of this
    phenomenon, which concerns the large majority of the channels and more than
    half the videos in our corpus. Our analysis indicates that most fakes news
    are corrected relatively late in the life of the videos and that the ﬁnal
    view counts of the videos are not independent from the fake views they
    received. We discuss the potential harm that delays in corrections could
    produce in content diﬀusion: by inﬂating views counts, illegitimate views
    could make a video appear more popular than it is and unwarrantedly
    encourage its human and algorithmic recommendation. Unfortunately, we cannot
    oﬀer a deﬁnitive assessment of this phenomenon, because YouTube provides no
    information on fake views in its API or interface. This paper is, therefore,
    also a call for greater transparency by YouTube and other online platforms
    about information that can have crucial implications for the quality of
    online public debate.

    "A new, counterintuitive theory for how social networks influence the spread
    of behavior. New social movements, technologies, and public-health
    initiatives often struggle to take off, yet many diseases disperse rapidly
    without issue. Can the lessons learned from the viral diffusion of diseases
    be used to improve the spread of beneficial behaviors and innovations? In
    How Behavior Spreads, Damon Centola presents over a decade of original
    research examining how changes in societal behavior--in voting, health,
    technology, and finance--occur and the ways social networks can be used to
    influence how they propagate. Centola's startling findings show that the
    same conditions accelerating the viral expansion of an epidemic unexpectedly
    inhibit the spread of behaviors. While it is commonly believed that "weak
    ties"--long-distance connections linking acquaintances--lead to the quicker
    spread of behaviors, in fact the exact opposite holds true. Centola
    demonstrates how the most well-known, intuitive ideas about social networks
    have caused past diffusion efforts to fail, and how such efforts might
    succeed in the future. Pioneering the use of Web-based methods to understand
    how changes in people's social networks alter their behaviors, Centola
    illustrates the ways in which these insights can be applied to solve
    countless problems of organizational change, cultural evolution, and social
    innovation. His findings offer important lessons for public health workers,
    entrepreneurs, and activists looking to harness networks for social
    change.Practical and informative, How Behavior Spreads is a must-read for
    anyone interested in how the theory of social networks can transform our
    world"--Provided by publisher

    Mixed-mode surveys are popular as they can save costs and maintain (or
    improve) response rates relative to single-mode surveys. Nevertheless, it is
    not yet clear how design decisions like survey mode or questionnaire length
    impact measurement quality. In this study, we compare measurement quality in
    an experiment of three distinct survey designs implemented in the German
    sample of the European Values Study: a single-mode face-to-face design, a
    mixed-mode mail/web design, and a shorter (matrix) questionnaire in the
    mixed-mode design. We compare measurement quality in different ways,
    including differences in distributions across several data quality
    indicators as well as equivalence testing over 140 items in 25 attitudinal
    scales. We ﬁnd similar data quality across the survey designs, although the
    mixed-mode survey shows more item nonresponse compared to the single-mode
    survey.

    "We are in an age of big data where all of our everyday interactions and
    transactions generate data. Much of this data is spatial - it is collected
    some-where - and identifying analytical insight from trends and patterns in
    these increasing rich digital footprints presents a number of challenges.
    These include the questioning of classical statistical hypothesis testing
    (with Big Data almost everything is significant), the importance of data
    visualizations to support robust hypothesis development and the role of
    spatial data analytics to link different big spatial datasets and to support
    trend identification. This book builds on the tools and techniques described
    in An Introduction to R for Spatial Analysis and Mapping by Brunsdon and
    Comber, extending these into Big Spatial Data and Data Analytics. It
    reflects a number of recent developments in both thinking about Big Spatial
    Data and in handling such data in R, the open source statistical software,
    which have significantly increased R's ability to handle, process and
    visualize big data. As yet there are no text books which reflect these
    recent developments in data handling in R, that develop robust inferential
    methods for Big Data analysis, that include spatial operations in data
    analytics or that describe advanced spatial manipulations and visualizations
    of highly dimensional, spatially referenced data. This book addresses these
    gaps"--

    The increasing integration of technology into our lives has created
    unprecedented volumes of data on society’s everyday behaviour. Such data
    opens up exciting new opportunities to work towards a quantitative
    understanding of our complex social systems, within the realms of a new
    discipline known as Computational Social Science. Against a background of
    ﬁnancial crises, riots and international epidemics, the urgent need for a
    greater comprehension of the complexity of our interconnected global society
    and an ability to apply such insights in policy decisions is clear. This
    manifesto outlines the objectives of this new scientiﬁc direction,
    considering the challenges involved in it, and the extensive impact on
    science, technology and society that the success of this endeavour is likely
    to bring about.

    MPI for Python provides bindings of the message passing interface (MPI)
    standard for the Python programming language and allows any Python program
    to exploit multiple processors. In its ﬁrst release, MPI for Python was
    constructed on top of the MPI-1 speciﬁcation deﬁning an object-oriented
    interface that closely followed the MPI-2 C + + bindings, and provided
    support for communications of general Python objects. In the latest release,
    this package is improved to enable direct blocking/non-blocking
    communication of numeric arrays, and to support almost all MPI-2 features.

    We study learning on social media with an equilibrium model of users
    interacting with shared news stories. Rational users arrive sequentially and
    each observes an original story (i.e., a private signal) and a sample of
    predecessors’ stories in a news feed, then decides which stories to share.
    The observed sample of stories depends on what predecessors share as well as
    the sampling algorithm, which represents a design choice of the platform. We
    focus on how much the algorithm relies on virality (how many times a story
    has been previously shared) when generating news feeds. Showing users more
    viral stories can increase information aggregation, but it can also generate
    steady states where most shared stories are wrong. Such misleading steady
    states selfperpetuate, as users who observe these wrong stories develop
    wrong beliefs, and thus rationally continue to share them. We ﬁnd that these
    bad steady states appear discontinuously, and even a benevolent platform
    designer either accepts these misleading steady states or induces fragile
    learning outcomes in the optimal design.

    Two-step cluster analysis was used to test the hypothesis that a visual
    model could be developed to identify patterns in the last 45 years of global
    terrorism. The six-factor cluster analysis model was statistically
    significant with a fair silhouette estimate of cohesion and separation.
    Terrorist attack methodologies of assassinations, armed assaults and
    bombings figured prominently in most of the segments, but national culture
    and ideology were also present as factors in some clusters. The majority of
    lethal deaths, injuries and properties damaged by terrorists were in India,
    Columbia, Iraq, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Logistic regression was then
    applied to test the hypothesis that combinations of terrorist attack
    methodology and ideology could estimate the risk of a terrorist strike being
    successful. The odds ratio was statistically significant but the results
    were theoretically weak in supporting the hypothesis. Hijacking was 1.131
    times more likely to be successful as compared with other types of global
    terrorist methodologies, and the relative risk of a terrorist strike being
    committed by foreign immigrants was 1.013 higher as compared with domestic
    terrorists. The implications were generalized to risk management decision
    makers and social policy planners.

    A way to simulate the basic interactions between two individuals with
    different opinions, in the context of strategic game theory, is proposed.
    Various games are considered, which produce different kinds of opinion
    formation dynamics. First, by assuming that all individuals (players) are
    equals, we obtain the bounded confidence model of continuous opinion
    dynamics proposed by Deffuant et al. In such a model a tolerance threshold
    is defined, such that individuals with difference in opinion larger than the
    threshold can not interact. Then, we consider that the individuals have
    different inclinations to change opinion and different abilities in
    convincing the others. In this way, we obtain the so-called "Stubborn
    individuals and Orators" (SO) model, a generalization of the Deffuant et al.
    model, in which the threshold tolerance is different for every couple of
    individuals. We explore, by numerical simulations, the dynamics of the SO
    model, and we propose further generalizations that can be implemented.

    ABSTRACT What does the American public label as “terrorism?” How do people
    think about the factors motivating violence, and in turn, the policies that
    are favored? Using ingroup and outgroup dynamics, we argue that the
    terrorist label is more readily applied to Arab-Americans than Whites, and
    to members of militant groups. Moreover, people attribute different motives
    to violence committed by Arabs versus Whites, and favor different policies
    in response. We conducted an experiment where we randomly assigned one of
    six stories about a failed armed attack, each with a different combination
    of ethnicity and group affiliation. We find that an Arab ethnicity and
    Islamist group affiliation increase the likelihood of labeling an act as
    terrorism. Attacks by Whites and members of a White supremacist group are
    less likely to be labeled terrorism. Rather, Whites are more likely to be
    called “mass shooters.” Despite never discussing motive, Arab-American
    attackers are more likely to be ascribed political or religious motives,
    while White suspects are more likely to be seen as mentally ill. Lastly, an
    Arab ethnicity increases support for counterterrorism policies and decreases
    support for mental health care.

    In a high-choice media environment, there are fears that individuals will
    select media and content that reinforce their existing beliefs and lead to
    segregation based on interest and/or partisanship. This could lead to
    partisan echo chambers among those who are politically interested and could
    contribute to a growing gap in knowledge between those who are politically
    interested and those who are not. However, the high-choice environment also
    allows individuals, including those who are politically interested, to
    consume a wide variety of media, which could lead them to more diverse
    content and perspectives. This study examines the relationship between
    political interest as well as media diversity and being caught in an echo
    chamber (measured by five different variables). Using a nationally
    representative survey of adult internet users in the United Kingdom (N =
    2000), we find that those who are interested in politics and those with
    diverse media diets tend to avoid echo chambers. This work challenges the
    impact of echo chambers and tempers fears of partisan segregation since only
    a small segment of the population are likely to find themselves in an echo
    chamber. We argue that single media studies and studies which use narrow
    definitions and measurements of being in an echo chamber are flawed because
    they do not test the theory in the realistic context of a multiple media
    environment.

  abstract: >-
    External validity of randomized experiments is a focus of long-standing
    debates in the social sciences. While the issue has been extensively studied
    at the conceptual level, in practice, few empirical studies have explicit
    analysis aimed towards externally valid inferences. In this article, we make
    three contributions to improve empirical approaches for external validity.
    First, we propose a formal framework that encompasses four dimensions of
    external validity; X-, T -, Y -, and C-validity (units, treatments,
    outcomes, and contexts). The proposed framework synthesizes diverse external
    validity concerns that arise in practice. We then distinguish two goals of
    generalization. To conduct eﬀect-generalization —generalizing the magnitude
    of causal eﬀects, we introduce three estimators of the target population
    causal eﬀects. For sign-generalization — assessing whether the direction of
    causal eﬀects is generalizable, we propose a novel multiple-testing
    procedure under weaker assumptions. We illustrate our methods through three
    applications covering ﬁeld, survey, and lab experiments.

  abstract: >-
    How do protest actions impact public support for social movements? Here we
    test the claim that extreme protest actions—protest behaviors perceived to
    be harmful to others, highly disruptive, or both—typically reduce support
    for social movements. Across 6 experiments, including 3 that were
    preregistered, participants indicated less support for social movements that
    used more extreme protest actions. This result obtained across a variety of
    movements (e.g., animal rights, anti-Trump, anti-abortion) and extreme
    protest actions (e.g., blocking highways, vandalizing property). Further, in
    5 of 6 studies, negative reactions to extreme protest actions also led
    participants to support the movement’s central cause less, and these effects
    were largely independent of individuals’ prior ideology or views on the
    issue. In all studies we found effects were driven by diminished social
    identification with the movement. In Studies 4 – 6, serial mediation
    analyses detailed a more in-depth model: observers viewed extreme protest
    actions to be immoral, reducing observers’ emotional connection to the
    movement and, in turn, reducing identification with and support for the
    movement. Taken together with prior research showing that extreme protest
    actions can be effective for applying pressure to institutions and raising
    awareness of movements, these findings suggest an activist’s dilemma, in
    which the same protest actions that may offer certain benefits are also
    likely to undermine popular support for social movements.

  abstract: >-
    The most widespread method of computing confidence intervals (CIs) in
    complex surveys is to add and subtract the margin of error (MOE) from the
    point estimate, where the MOE is the estimated standard error multiplied by
    the suitable Gaussian quantile. This Wald-type interval is used by the
    American Community Survey (ACS), the largest US household sample survey. For
    inferences on small proportions with moderate sample sizes, this method
    often results in marked under-coverage and lower CI endpoint less than 0. We
    assess via simulation the coverage and width, in complex sample surveys, of
    seven alternatives to the Wald interval for a binomial proportion with
    sample size replaced by the ‘effective sample size,’ that is, the sample
    size divided by the design effect. Building on previous work by the present
    authors, our simulations address the impact of clustering, stratification,
    different stratum sampling fractions, and stratum-specific proportions. We
    show that all intervals undercover when there is clustering and design
    effects are computed from a simple design-based estimator of sampling
    variance. Coverage can be better calibrated for the alternatives to Wald by
    improving estimation of the effective sample size through superpopulation
    modeling. This approach is more effective in our simulations than previously
    proposed modifications of effective sample size. We recommend intervals of
    the Wilson or Bayes uniform prior form, with the Jeffreys prior interval not
    far behind.

  abstract: >-
    Statistical power analysis provides the conventional approach to assess
    error rates when designing a research study. However, power analysis is
    flawed in that a narrow emphasis on statistical significance is placed as
    the primary focus of study design. In noisy, small-sample settings,
    statistically significant results can often be misleading. To help
    researchers address this problem in the context of their own studies, we
    recommend design calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate
    being in the wrong direction (Type S [sign] error) and (b) the factor by
    which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated (Type M [magnitude]
    error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We illustrate with examples from
    recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design
    calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes
    based on external information.

  abstract: >-
    The general principles of Bayesian data analysis imply that models for
    survey responses should be constructed conditional on all variables that
    affect the probability of inclusion and nonresponse, which are also the
    variables used in survey weighting and clustering. However, such models can
    quickly become very complicated, with potentially thousands of
    poststratiﬁcation cells. It is then a challenge to develop general families
    of multilevel probability models that yield reasonable Bayesian inferences.
    We discuss in the context of several ongoing public health and social
    surveys. This work is currently open-ended, and we conclude with thoughts on
    how research could proceed to solve these problems.

    Crimes cause terror and cost our society dearly in several ways. Data mining
    can be used to model crime profiling. Here we look at use of clustering
    algorithm for a data mining approach to analyze the crimes patterns. We will
    look at k-means clustering to aid in the process of crime profiling. We
    applied these techniques to primary crime data from Delhi police first
    information report (FIR) records. In this paper, firstly we desire to
    estimate which type of crime is dominant in Delhi city, India. Accordingly
    crime is divided into three types heinous crime, non-heinous crime and
    special & local laws violation. Second estimation is to find which area
    categories are more sensitive towards, areas categories which are considered
    are slums, residential, commercial, VIP zones, travel points and markets.
    Third is to show distributions of each crime type in every area category.

    Why do people justify intergroup violence between police and protesters in
    social protests? This article examines attitudes towards the violence
    perpetrated by police officers against protesters and the violence carried
    out by protesters against police officers in the context of the post-social
    outbreak of October 18, 2019 in Chile. We evaluate the role played by the
    perception of injustice in the procedures and the treatment of police
    officers towards protesters, the evaluation of the legitimacy of police
    officers and group identification with protesters and police officers in
    predicting the justification of violence. We present the results of a survey
    on legitimacy and police violence carried out among adults in Chile during
    January 2021 (n = 2,717). Through a Path Analysis, we found that the
    perception of injustice in the procedures through which the police treat
    protesters is a key factor in predicting the perception of legitimacy of the
    police, especially among people who identify with the protesters.
    Furthermore, by reducing the legitimacy of the police, the perception of
    injustice in the procedures and the treatment translates into lower levels
    of justification of police violence and to greater levels of justification
    of protestor violence. The article finishes by highlighting the importance
    of considering the perceptions of injustice in the procedures and treatment
    of police officers in order to reduce the conflict between police officers
    and protesters in Chile.

    This article presents a survey of the state of the art in geocoding
    practices through a cross-disciplinary historical review of existing
    literature. We explore the evolving concept of geocoding and the fundamental
    components of the process. Frequently encountered sources of error and
    uncertainty are discussed as well as existing measures used to quantify
    them. An examination of common pitfalls and persistent challenges in the
    geocoding process is presented, and the traditional methods for overcoming
    them are described.

  abstract: >-
    Fiscal rules are laws aimed at reducing the incentive to accumulate debt,
    and many countries adopt them to discipline local governments. Yet, their
    effectiveness is disputed because of commitment and enforcement problems. We
    study their impact applying a quasi-experimental design in Italy. In 1999,
    the central government imposed fiscal rules on municipal governments, and in
    2001 relaxed them below 5,000 inhabitants. We exploit the before/after and
    discontinuous policy variation, and show that relaxing fiscal rules
    increases deficits and lowers taxes. The effect is larger if the mayor can
    be reelected, the number of parties is higher, and voters are older. (JEL

    The factors that are affecting the world are terrorism, economy, political
    changes, pollution, etc. Out of which terrorism is one the biggest factor
    which is affecting the economy, society along with loss of precious human
    lives. In this paper, the data mining techniques are implemented to infer
    certain trends and pattern of terrorist attacks in India. K-means clustering
    is used to determine the year in which the terrorist groups were most active
    and also which terrorist group has affected the most. The experimental
    result is implemented in Rapidminer tool to determine the active group and
    the affected year.

  abstract: >-
    People frequently compare the racial composition of stopped individuals with
    the racial composition of the local residential population to assess unequal
    policing. This type of evaluation rests on the assumption that the
    census-derived population accurately reflects the population at risk to be
    stopped. For vehicle stops, existing research indicates that this assumption
    is very problematic, resulting in highly unreliable assessments of
    black-white policing disparities. However, there is little research on the
    significance of this assumption for stopped urban pedestrians. Analyzing
    more than 100,000 investigatory stops in Chicago, the present study finds
    that similar to vehicle stops, most pedestrian investigations do not involve
    neighborhood residents, and estimates of racial disproportionality are
    inflated when this issue is ignored. Still, the degree to which estimates
    are inflated appears less than that previously reported for vehicle stops,
    and sizable racial disparities remain unexplained after the issue is taken
    into account. Implications for future research are discussed.

  abstract: >-
    Use of internet panels to collect survey data is increasing because it is
    cost-effective, enables access to large and diverse samples quickly, takes
    less time than traditional methods to obtain back for analysis, and the
    standardization of data collection process makes studies easy to replicate.
    A variety of probability-based panels have been created including
    Telepanel/CentERpanel, Knowledge Networks (now GFK KnowledgePanel®), the
    American Life Panel, the LISS Panel, and the Understanding American Study
    panel. Despite the advantage of having a known denominator (sampling frame),
    the probability-based internet panels often have low recruitment
    participation rates and some have argued that there is little practical
    difference between opting out of a probability sample and opting into a
    non-probability (convenience) internet panel. This paper provides an
    overview of both probability-based and convenience panels, discussing
    potential benefits and cautions for each method, and summarizing approaches
    used to weight panel respondents to better represent the underlying
    population. Challenges in using internet panel data such as false answers,
    careless responses, giving the same answer repeatedly, getting multiple
    surveys from the same respondent, and panelists being members of multiple
    panels are discussed. There is more to be learned about internet panels
    generally and web-based data collection along with opportunities to evaluate
    data collected using mobile devices and social media platforms.

    Understanding perception is critical to effective visualization design. With
    its low cost and scalability, crowdsourcing presents an attractive option
    for evaluating the large design space of visualizations; however, it ﬁrst
    requires validation. In this paper, we assess the viability of Amazon’s
    Mechanical Turk as a platform for graphical perception experiments. We
    replicate previous studies of spatial encoding and luminance contrast and
    compare our results. We also conduct new experiments on rectangular area
    perception (as in treemaps or cartograms) and on chart size and gridline
    spacing. Our results demonstrate that crowdsourced perception experiments
    are viable and contribute new insights for visualization design. Lastly, we
    report cost and performance data from our experiments and distill
    recommendations for the design of crowdsourced studies.

  abstract: >-
    Why do governments use deadly force against unarmed protesters? The
    government’s threat perception may be a function of the mobilization
    potential of the opposition and/or the size of the ruling elite’s support
    coalition. Given the high salience of ethnicity in African politics,
    governments that depend on small ethnic coalitions will see peaceful
    protests as more threatening, as the opposition may be able to draw on
    larger numbers of potential dissidents and excluded groups. Alternately,
    governments with larger, more homogeneous ethnic coalitions will find
    nonviolent mobilization less threatening and will be less likely to respond
    with deadly force. Using the Social Conflict Analysis Database, we
    demonstrate that as the size – and to a lesser extent homogeneity – of the
    ethnic ruling coalition grows, governments are significantly less likely to
    use deadly force against nonviolent protesters. This finding is robust to
    several operationalizations of the size of the government’s support
    coalition, the inclusion of other measures of ethnic demographics, and
    estimators that account for the hierarchical nature of the data. Threat
    perception hinges not only on dissident tactics but on their demands, their
    mobilization potential, and their capacity to impose costs on the
    government. This article demonstrates that the size and composition of the
    government’s ethnic support base matters as well.

  abstract: >-
    Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is undoubtedly the most common
    inferential technique used to justify claims in the social sciences.
    However, even staunch defenders of NHST agree that its outcomes are often
    misinterpreted. Confidence intervals (CIs) have frequently been proposed as
    a more useful alternative to NHST, and their use is strongly encouraged in
    the APA Manual. Nevertheless, little is known about how researchers
    interpret CIs. In this study, 120 researchers and 442 students—all in the
    field of psychology—were asked to assess the truth value of six particular
    statements involving different interpretations of a CI. Although all six
    statements were false, both researchers and students endorsed, on average,
    more than three statements, indicating a gross misunderstanding of CIs.
    Self-declared experience with statistics was not related to researchers’
    performance, and, even more surprisingly, researchers hardly outperformed
    the students, even though the students had not received any education on
    statistical inference whatsoever. Our findings suggest that many researchers
    do not know the correct interpretation of a CI. The misunderstandings
    surrounding pvalues and CIs are particularly unfortunate because they
    constitute the main tools by which psychologists draw conclusions from data.

    Terrorist attacks are events which hinder the development of a region.
    Before the terrorist attacks, we need to conduct a graded evaluation of the
    terrorist attacks. After getting the level of terrorist attacks, we can
    fight terrorist organizations more effectively. This paper builds rating
    models for terrorist attacks, hidden or emerging terrorist organization
    classification discovery models, terrorist organization alliance network
    models and more, through quantitative research of the Global Terrorism
    Database, which solved the event classification. Through studying relevant
    literature and the variables of the Global Terrorism Database, this paper
    sorted out 25 observation variables related to the impact level (level of
    harm) of terrorist attacks. By establishing a mathematical model of factor
    analysis, 11 factors related to the impact level (level of harm) of
    terrorist attacks were constructed, and the variance of the contribution of
    each factor was used as the weight to calculate the comprehensive rate of
    the impact level of each terrorist attack. Finally, K-means clustering
    method is used to cluster and analyze the comprehensive rate of impact
    level, and the top 10 terrorist attacks with the highest impact level in the
    past two decades were obtained.

  abstract: >-
    Finite players allocate limited attention capacities between biased primary
    sources and the other players in order to gather information about an
    uncertain state. The resulting Poisson attention network transmits
    information from primary sources to a player either directly or indirectly
    through the other players. Rational inattention generates heterogeneous
    demands for information among players with heterogeneous preferences. In an
    echo-chamber equilibrium, each player restricts attention to his own-biased
    source and like-minded friends, who, by attending to the same primary source
    as his, serve as secondary sources in case the information transmission from
    the primary source to him is disrupted. We examine when and why echo-chamber
    equilibria would arise, and why a mandatory exposure of players to all
    biased sources could dissolve echo chambers but undermine welfare. We
    develop a new method for characterizing the opinion distribution within an
    echo chamber, establishing the law of the few even when the difference
    between players is minimal, and pointing to the controversy of policy
    interventions that augment the visibility of information sources.

  abstract: >-
    With the advancement of GPS and remote sensing technologies, large amounts
    of geospatial data are being collected from various domains, driving the
    need for effective and efﬁcient prediction methods. Given spatial data
    samples with explanatory features and targeted responses (categorical or
    continuous) at a set of locations, the spatial prediction problem aims to
    learn a model that can predict the response variable based on explanatory
    features. The problem is important with broad applications in earth science,
    urban informatics, geosocial media analytics and public health, but is
    challenging due to the unique characteristics of spatial data, including
    spatial autocorrelation, heterogeneity, limited ground truth, and multiple
    scales and resolutions. This paper provides a systematic review on
    principles and methods in spatial prediction. We provide a taxonomy of
    methods categorized by the key challenge they address. For each method, we
    introduce its underlying assumption, theoretical foundation, and discuss its
    advantages and disadvantages. We also discuss spatiotemporal extensions of
    methods. Our goal is to help interdisciplinary domain scientists choose
    techniques to solve their problems, and more importantly, to help data
    mining researchers to understand the main principles and methods in spatial
    prediction and identify future research opportunities.

  abstract: >-
    Cyber crime is a worldwide problem, with a global reach. Cyber crimes do not
    respect national boundaries, and so can be sent to and from anywhere in the
    world. Many reports, mostly by cyber security firms, regularly release
    information ranking the different nations in terms of top cyber crime
    output, broken down into varying cyber crime types. However, little has been
    done to classify nations according to separate cyber crime typologies using
    any multivariate methods. Instead, reporting is descriptive and
    unidimensional. The present research sought to fill this gap by conducting
    K-means clustering analysis on a sample of 190 countries using seven
    dimensions of cyber crime ranging from malware, fraud, spam, and digital
    piracy, as well as measures of GDP and internet use. The findings determined
    that nations can be broken down into four distinct categories based on cyber
    crime activity: low cyber crime countries, non-serious cyber crime
    countries, advance fee fraud countries, and phishing scam countries. The
    implications of these findings and the directions for future research are
    discussed.

    Spatio-temporal c1ustering is a process of grouping objects based on their
    spatial and temporal similarity. It is relatively new subfield of data
    mining which gained high popularity especially in geographie information
    scienees due to the pervasiveness of all kinds of location-based or
    environmental devices that record position, time or/and environmental
    properties of an object or set of objects in real-time. As a consequence,
    different types and large amounts of spatio-temporal data became available
    that introduce new challenges to data analysis and require novel approaches
    to knowledge discovery. In this chapter we concentrate on the
    spatio-temporal c1ustering in geographic space. First, we provide a
    c1assification of different types of spatio-temporal data. Then, we focus on
    one type of spatio-temporal c1ustering - trajectory c1ustering, provide an
    overview of the state-of-the-art approaches and methods of spatio-temporal
    c1ustering and finally present several scenarios in different application
    domains such as movement, ceIIular networks and environmental studies.

  abstract: >-
    Although it is well established that self-administered questionnaires tend
    to yield fewer reports in the socially desirable direction than do
    interviewer-administered questionnaires, less is known about whether
    different modes of self-administration vary in their effects on socially
    desirable responding. In addition, most mode comparison studies lack
    validation data and thus cannot separate the effects of differential
    nonresponse bias from the effects of differences in measurement error. This
    paper uses survey and record data to examine mode effects on the reporting
    of potentially sensitive information by a sample of recent university
    graduates. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of three modes of data
    collection—conventional computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI),
    interactive voice recognition (IVR), and the Web—and were asked about both
    desirable and undesirable attributes of their academic experiences.
    University records were used to evaluate the accuracy of the answers and to
    examine differences in nonresponse bias by mode. Web administration
    increased the level of reporting of sensitive information and reporting
    accuracy relative to conventional CATI, with IVR intermediate between the
    other two modes. Both mode of data collection and the actual status of the
    respondent influenced whether respondents found an item sensitive.

    "Text Mining (or text data mining or text analytics) is the process of
    extracting useful and high-quality information from text by devising
    patterns and trends. R provides an extensive ecosystem to mine text through
    its many frameworks and packages. Starting with basic information about the
    statistics concepts used in text mining, this book will teach you how to
    access, cleanse, and process text using the R language and will equip you
    with the tools and the associated knowledge about different tagging,
    chunking, and entailment approaches and their usage in natural language
    processing. Moving on, this book will teach you different dimensionality
    reduction techniques and their implementation in R. Next, we will cover
    pattern recognition in text data utilizing classification mechanisms,
    perform entity recognition, and develop an ontology learning framework. By
    the end of the book, you will develop a practical application from the
    concepts learned, and will understand how text mining can be leveraged to
    analyze the massively available data on social media." --Publisher's

  abstract: >-
    Terrorism is designed to change minds by destroying bodies; it is a form of
    costly signaling. Terrorists employ five primary strategies of costly
    signaling: attrition, intimidation, provocation, spoiling, and outbidding.
    The main targets of persuasion are the enemy and the population that the
    terrorists hope to represent or control. Terrorists wish to signal that they
    have the strength and will to impose costs on those who oppose them, and
    that the enemy and moderate groups on the terrorists' side cannot be trusted
    and should not be supported. Each strategy works well under certain
    conditions and poorly under others. State responses to one strategy may be
    inappropriate for other strategies. In some cases, however, terrorists are
    pursuing a combination of strategies, and the response must also work well
    against this combination.

- id: latanePsychologySocialImpact
  abstract: >-
    The author proposes a theory of social impact specifying the effect of other
    persons on an individual. According to the theory, when other people are the
    source of impact and the individual is the target, impact should be a
    multiplicative function of the strength, immediacy, and number of other
    people. Furthermore, impact should take the form of a power function, with
    the marginal effect of the Nth other person being less than that of the (N —
    l)th. Finally, when other people stand with the individual as the target of
    forces from outside the group, impact should be divided such that the
    resultant is an inverse power function of the strength, immediacy, and
    number of persons standing together. The author reviews relevant evidence
    from research on conformity and imitation, stage fright and embarrassment,
    news interest, bystander intervention, tipping, inquiring for Christ,
    productivity in groups, and crowding in rats. He also discusses the
    unresolved issues and desirable characteristics of the theory.

    Terrorist attacks have become a serious source of risk affecting the
    security of the international community. Using the Global Terrorism Database
    (GTD), in order to quantitatively study past terrorist attacks and their
    temporal and spatial evolution the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used
    to classify the degree of damage from terrorist attacks. The various factors
    influencing terrorist attacks were extracted and represented in three
    dimensions. Subsequently, using MATLAB for analysis and processing, the
    grading standards for terrorist attacks were classified into five levels
    according to the degree of hazard. Based on this grading standard, the top
    ten terrorist attacks with the highest degree of hazard in the past two
    decades were listed. Because the characteristics and habits of a terrorist
    or group exhibit a certain consistency, the K-means cluster analysis method
    was used to classify terrorists according to region, type of attack, type of
    target and type of weapon used by the terrorists. Several attacks that might
    have been committed by the same terrorist organization or individual at
    different times and in different locations were classified into one
    category, and the top five categories were selected according to the degree
    of sabotage inflicted by the organization or individual. Finally, the
    spatiotemporal evolution of terrorist attacks in the past three years was
    analyzed, considering the terrorist attack targets and key areas of
    terrorist attacks. The Middle East, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and Africa
    were predicted to be the regions that will be most seriously affected by
    future global terrorist events. The terrorist attacks in Southeast Asia are
    expected to become more severe, and the scope of terrorist attacks in Africa
    is expected to widen. Civilians are the targets most at risk for terrorist
    attacks, and the corresponding risk index is considerably higher than it is
    for other targets. The results of this research can help individuals and the
    government to enable a better understanding of terrorism, improve awareness
    to prevent terrorism and enhance emergency management and rescue, and
    provide a solid and reliable basis and reference for joint counterterrorism
    in various countries and regions.

  abstract: >-
    The key assumption of spiral of silence theory is that opinion climate
    perceptions affect political opinion expression. We meta-analyzed the
    strength of this relationship and clarified the impact of theoretically
    relevant moderators. Sixty-six studies collectively including more than
    27,000 participants were located. We observed a significant positive
    relationship (r = .10; Zr = .10) between opinion climate and opinion
    expression. This relationship was not weaker in online as compared with
    offline opinion expression environments. Also, the relationship did not vary
    by the number of the targets of opinion expression, the opinion of the
    targets, the opinion climate characteristics, and the design, measurement,
    and sample characteristics. The largest silencing effect (r = .34), however,
    was observed when participants talk to their family, friends, or neighbors
    about obtrusive issues. Overall, our findings suggest that the relationship
    between opinion climate perception and political opinion expression is
    stronger and more robust than previously thought.

  abstract: >-
    Terrorism's efficacy, like beauty, is in the eyes of the beholder in that
    those who commit political violence deliberately directed against civilians
    believe in the success of their deeds. In one respect, most if not all
    terrorists do achieve an important goal. Whenever they strike, especially if
    they stage socalled terrorist spectaculars, their deeds assure them massive
    news coverage and the attention of the general public and governmental
    decision makers in their particular target societies. Moreover, given the
    global nature of the communication system, the perpetrators of international
    and domestic terrorism also tap into the international media and thereby
    receive the attention of publics and governments beyond their immediate
    target countries. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once said
    that publicity is the oxygen of terrorism. Without publicity, terrorism
    would be like the proverbial tree that falls in the forest and the press is
    not there to report-it would be as if the incident never happened. The term
    "mass-mediated terrorism" signifies the centrality of media considerations
    in the calculus of political violence that is committed by nonstate actors
    against civilians.' While publicity is not the ultimate objective,
    terrorists recognize that it is the means to advertise and further their
    larger political ends. This article examines whether and how the architects
    of the horrific events of September 11 succeeded in achieving their media
    goals.

  abstract: >-
    Properties of spatially explicit data are often ignored or inadequately
    handled in machine learning for spatial domains of application. At the same
    time, resources that would identify these properties and investigate their
    influence and methods to handle them in machine learning applications are
    lagging behind. In this survey of the literature, we seek to identify and
    discuss spatial properties of data that influence the performance of machine
    learning. We review some of the best practices in handling such properties
    in spatial domains and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. We
    recognize two broad strands in this literature. In the first, the properties
    of spatial data are developed in the spatial observation matrix without
    amending the substance of the learning algorithm; in the other, spatial data
    properties are handled in the learning algorithm itself. While the latter
    have been far less explored, we argue that they offer the most promising
    prospects for the future of spatial machine learning.

  abstract: >-
    Over the last 30 years, trends such as service sector growth, welfare state
    expansion and rising female participation rates have promoted increasing
    heterogeneity within the occupational system. Accordingly, this article
    argues that the class map has to be redrawn in order to grasp these changes
    in the employment structure. For that purpose, it develops the bases of a
    new class schema that partly shifts its focus from hierarchical divisions to
    horizontal cleavages. The middle class is not conceptualized as a unitary
    grouping and the manual/non-manual divide is not used as a decisive class
    boundary. Instead, emphasis is put on differences in marketable skills and
    the work logic. The schema is expected to more accurately reﬂect the class
    location of unskilled service employees and to make visible the political
    divide within the salaried middle class. This expectation is empirically
    examined with survey data from Britain, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland.
    Findings for earnings and promotion prospects indicate that the schema
    successfully captures the hierarchical dimension in the class structure.
    Moreover, results for party support and union membership suggest that the
    schema grasps a salient horizontal cleavage between managers and
    sociocultural professionals.

  abstract: >-
    Introduction: Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter,
    among others have been used as a tool for staging protests, opinion polls,
    campaign strategy, medium of agitation and a place of interest expression
    especially during elections. Past studies have established people’s opinion
    elections using social media posts. The advent of state-of-the-art
    algorithms for unstructured text processing implies tremendous progress in
    natural language processing and understanding. Aim: In this work, a Natural
    Language framework is designed to understand Nigeria 2023 presidential
    election based on public opinion using Twitter dataset.

    Methods: Raw datasets concerning discourse around Nigeria 2023 elections
    from Twitter of 2,059,113 𝜒𝜒 18 dimensions were collected. Sentiment
    analysis was performed on the preprocessed dataset using three different
    machine learning models namely: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent
    Neural Network, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
    (BERT) and Linear Support Vector Classifier (LSVC) models. Personal tweet
    analysis of the three candidates provided insight on their campaign
    strategies and personalities while public tweet analysis established the
    public’s opinion about them. The performance of the models was also compared
    using accuracy, recall, false positive rate, precision and F-measure.

    Results: LSTM model gave an accuracy, precision, recall, AUC and f-measure
    of 88%, 82.7%, 87.2% , 87.6% and 82.9% respectively; the BERT model gave an
    accuracy, precision, recall, AUC and f-measure of 94%, 88.5%, 92.5%, 94.7%
    and 91.7% respectively while the LSVC model gave an accuracy, precision,
    recall, AUC and f-measure of 73%, 81.4%, 76.4%, 81.2% and 79.2%
    respectively.

    Conclusion: The experimental results show that sentiment analysis and other
    Natural Language Processing tasks can aid in the understanding of the social
    media space. Results also revealed the leverage of each aspirant towards
    winning the election. We conclude that sentiment analysis can form a general
    basis for generating insights for election and modeling election outcomes.

  abstract: >-
    The indigenous Amazonian villages of Peru have maintained until the present
    day a tension- and conflict-filled relationship with political power. This
    unfortunate social circumstance has its roots in the process of colonization
    and is sustained, in part, by the belief that the Amazonian people and their
    territories are “savage” and need to be “civilized.” This belief forms part
    of a fundamentally racist ideological system, which attempts to justify the
    colonizing venture to which these villages are subjected. This racist
    ideology has a cultural base in the sense that it links “race” (the
    phenotype) with “culture” the latter understood as a collection of social
    factors, such as education, language, customs, occupation and place of
    origin.

  abstract: >-
    The vagueness that attends the notion of terrorism is a source of constant
    confusion. This article proposes to shift the discussion from the concept of
    terrorism to that of terror, in the psychological sense of the term, and
    thus open up a new perspective on the analysis of the emotional impact of
    political violence. This requires us to refine the conceptual framework and
    make the terminology we use compatible with the empirical data we have on
    the psychological sequelae of violence.

    Este artículo aborda el papel clave de la Comisión de la Verdad y
    Reconciliación (CVR) peruana en el regreso de la categoría “indígena”,
    nuevamente en uso en el escenario público nacional del siglo XXI. Analizamos
    su influencia en las políticas de reparaciones y sus repercusiones en las
    formas de identificación de las poblaciones andinas. El análisis del
    contenido del Informe final de la CVR y de las actividades realizadas en el
    memorial El Ojo que Llora de Lima pone de relieve el proceso de etnización
    de la categoría de víctima, como inocente e indígena. La escenificación de
    esta figura positiva de lo indígena buscó contrarrestar el estigma asociado
    al “indio”, considerado como terrorista durante la guerra. Sin embargo, esta
    postura no deja de transmitir cierto esencialismo sobre la “otredad”
    interior. En su afán de visibilizar y valorar elementos culturales
    “andinos”, ¿los activistas de derechos humanos no corren el riesgo de
    reproducir el exotismo asociado a las poblaciones más afectadas por la
    guerra que ellos mismos denuncian en su lucha contra el racismo? Del mismo
    modo, vincular las comunidades campesinas contemporáneas con el pasado
    prehispánico reduce la posibilidad de reconocer plenamente a esta población
    rural del país como actores dinámicos, con su propia subjetividad política.
    Dirigir el foco hacia la réplica del memorial limeño en una comunidad
    campesina andina nos permite vislumbrar también cómo se redefinen las
    relaciones entre centro y periferia, mediante la construcción local de la
    memoria colectiva del conflicto armado interno.

  abstract: >-
    "Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a simulation technique widely used across
    social and life sciences. Recently it has made substantial gains in the
    field of archaeology. However, while the use of other digital methods has
    been increasing in general, the technical aspect of ABM methodology remains
    a significant obstacle for a wider adoption among academic and commercial
    archaeologists. This volume constitutes the first agent-based modeling
    textbook aimed at an archaeological audience. Its objectives are threefold:
    first, to provide lecturers with a ready-made but easily modifiable textbook
    for class teaching as the modules in digital archaeology become more
    ubiquitous and as the first generation of ABM modelers enter into
    lectureship positions; second, to provide archaeologists at any stage of
    education with a synthetic text for self-teaching; and third, to provide the
    community of ABM modelers with a reference publication that can be consulted
    when looking for a specific algorithm and its implementation or for previous
    ABM applications in a given research area"--

  abstract: >-
    With the current surge of simulation studies in archaeology, there is a
    growing concern for the lack of engagement and feedback between modelers and
    domain specialists. To facilitate this dialogue, I present a compact guide
    to the simulation modeling process applied to a common research topic and
    the focus of this special issue of Human Biology—human dispersals. The
    process of developing a simulation is divided into nine steps grouped in
    three phases. The conceptual phase consists of identifying research
    questions (step 1), fĳinding the most suitable method (step 2), designing
    the general framework and the resolution of the simulation (step 3), and
    fĳilling in that framework with the modeled entities and the rules of
    interactions (step 4). This is followed by the technical phase of coding and
    testing (step 5), parameterizing the simulation (step 6), and running it
    (step 7), and the results of the simulation are analyzed and
    recontextualized (step 8). In the dissemination phase, the fĳindings of the
    model are disseminated in publications and code repositories (step 9). Each
    step is defĳined and characterized and then illustrated with examples of
    published human dispersal simulation studies. While not aiming to be a
    comprehensive textbook-style guide to simulation, this overview of the
    process of modeling human dispersals should arm any nonmodeler with enough
    understanding to evaluate the quality, strengths, and weaknesses of any
    particular archaeological simulation and provide a starting point for
    further exploration of this common scientifĳic tool.

    Abstract. The aim of this paper is to analyze the distribution of alcohol
    consumption occurred within the main campus (CU) of the National Autonomous
    University of Mexico (UNAM), in a period of four years, through the study of
    their spatial relationships. Based on Tobler’s First Law which explains that
    “everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related
    than distant ones”, one can say that the distribution of alcohol consumption
    that extends into CU is determined by the spatial dependence of consumption
    areas, and spatial relationships that they have with their environment. To
    achieve this goal we used concepts of Geography of Crime, Spatial
    Dependency, Spatial Analysis and Modeling which through geographical
    information systems, provide a tool to help gain a better understanding of
    space and then integrate a solution study problem. The results of applying
    the model allowed determining possible areas of consumption within the study
    area, data that is important for the implementation of improved monitoring
    plans within the campus.

    This study analyzes the relationship between political ideology and
    different expressions of prejudice in a sample of inhabitants of the city of
    Lima (N = 199). The variables studied are: intolerance of uncertainty and
    ambiguity, the Left/Right Position, Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA),
    Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), Homophobia, Ambivalent Sexism and
    Prejudice toward ethnic minorities. Two structural equation models were
    proposed. One of them showed a better degree of fit and suggests that
    intolerance of uncertainty and ambiguity influences RWA and SDO. Also RWA
    and SDO influence the various forms of prejudice. However, RWA has a better
    predictive capability with respect to the diverse forms of prejudice in
    contrast to SDO. The final discussion proposes that is reasonable to use in
    Perú a multidimensional ideological approach, and the theoretical proposal
    of conservatism as motivated social cognition, to understand prejudice and
    negative stereotyping toward threatening or low-status groups. Individuals
    with greater tendency toward right-wing authoritarianism and conservatism
    tend to perceive these groups as threats to traditionally established social
    order.

    Este estudio analiza la relación entre la ideología política y diversas
    manifestaciones de prejuicio en una muestra de habitantes de la ciudad de
    Lima (N = 199). Las variables estudiadas son: la Intolerancia a la
    Incertidumbre y la Ambigüedad, la Posición Izquierda/Derecha, el
    Autoritarismo de Ala Derecha (RWA), la Orientación hacia la Dominancia
    Social (SDO), la Homofobia, el Sexismo Ambivalente y el Prejuicio hacia
    minorías étnicas amazónicas. Dos modelos de ecuaciones estructurales fueron
    propuestos. Uno de ellos presentó un mejor grado de ajuste y propone que la
    Intolerancia a la Incertidumbre y la Ambigüedad influyen sobre el RWA y la
    SDO. Asimismo, RWA y SDO influyen sobre las diversas expresiones de
    prejuicio. Sin embargo, el RWA en contraste con la SDO, presenta una mejor

    discusión final propone que en el Perú es razonable utilizar un enfoque
    ideológico multidimensional, así como la propuesta del conservadurismo como
    cognición social motivada para comprender el prejuicio y la estereotipia
    negativa hacia grupos percibidos como amenazantes o de bajo estatus.
    Individuos con mayor tendencia hacia el autoritarismo de derecha y el
    conservadurismo, tenderían a percibir a estos grupos como amenazas hacia el
    orden social tradicionalmente establecido.

  abstract: >-
    An irreverent, provocative, and visually fascinating look at what our online
    lives reveal about who we really are--and how this deluge of data will
    transform the science of human behavior. Big Data is used to spy on us, hire
    and fire us, and sell us things we don't need. In Dataclysm, Christian
    Rudder puts this flood of information to an entirely different use:
    understanding human nature. Drawing on terabytes of data from Twitter,
    Facebook, Reddit, OkCupid, and many other sites, Rudder examines the terrain
    of human experience. He charts the rise and fall of America's most reviled
    word through Google Search, examines the new dynamics of collaborative rage
    on Twitter, and traces human migration over time, showing how groups of
    people move from certain small towns to the same big cities across the
    globe. And he grapples with the challenge of maintaining privacy in a world
    where these explorations are possible. Audacious, entertaining, and
    illuminating, Dataclysm is a portrait of our essential selves--and a first
    look at a revolution in the making. --

    Findings derived from self-reported, structured survey questionnaires are
    commonly used in evaluation and applied research to inform policy-making and
    program decisions. Although there are a variety of issues related to the
    quality of survey evidence (e.g., sampling precision), the validity of
    response processes–how respondents process thoughts and perceptions when
    answering questionnaires–is crucial. We assess the extent to which cognitive
    interviews, used to test survey questions as part of the process of
    questionnaire design and refinement, can strengthen the quality of survey
    evidence for small- and medium-scale evaluations. To illustrate how
    cognitive interviews can reveal respondents' response processes and improved
    questionnaire interpretations, we present excerpts from two types of
    evaluations (e.g., needs assessment) in two domains (e.g., education). The
    paper concludes with a brief summary about how the use of cognitive
    interviews can be augmented in survey development, refinement, and
    adaptation to improve survey questionnaire interpretations in evaluations
    with limited resources.

    Standard statistical methods often provide no way to make accurate estimates
    about the characteristics of hidden populations such as injection drug
    users, the homeless, and artists. In this paper, we further develop a
    sampling and estimation technique called respondent-driven sampling, which
    allows researchers to make asymptotically unbiased estimates about these
    hidden populations. The sample is selected with a snowball-type design that
    can be done more cheaply, quickly, and easily than other methods currently
    in use. Further, we can show that under certain specified (and quite
    general) conditions, our estimates for the percentage of the population with
    a specific trait are asymptotically unbiased. We further show that these
    estimates are asymptotically unbiased no matter how the seeds are selected.
    We conclude with a comparison of respondent-driven samples of jazz musicians
    in New York and San Francisco, with corresponding institutional samples of
    jazz musicians from these cities. The results show that some standard
    methods for studying hidden populations can produce misleading results.

    What undermines cooperation in ethnically diverse communities? Scholars have
    focused on factors that explain the lack of inter-ethnic cooperation, such
    as prejudice or the difficulty to communicate and sanction across group
    boundaries. We direct attention to the fact that diverse communities are
    also often poor and ask whether poverty, rather than diversity, reduces
    cooperation. We developed a strategic cooperation game where we vary the
    income and racial identity of the interaction partner. We find that beliefs
    about how poor people behave have clear detrimental effects on cooperation:
    cooperation is lower when people are paired with low-income partners, and
    the effect is particularly strong when low-income people interact among
    themselves. We observe additional discrimination along racial lines when the
    interaction partner is poor. These findings imply that poverty and rising
    inequality may be a serious threat to social cohesion, especially under
    conditions of high socioeconomic segregation.

  abstract: >-
    While online social media offers a way for ignored or stiﬂed voices to be
    heard, it also allows users a platform to spread hateful speech. Such speech
    usually originates in fringe communities, yet it can spill over into
    mainstream channels. In this paper, we measure the impact of joining fringe
    hateful communities in terms of hate speech propagated to the rest of the
    social network. We leverage data from Reddit to assess the effect of joining
    one type of echo chamber: a digital community of likeminded users exhibiting
    hateful behavior. We measure members’ usage of hate speech outside the
    studied community before and after they become active participants. Using
    Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis as a causal inference method, we
    gauge the spillover effect, in which hateful language from within a certain
    community can spread outside that community by using the level of
    out-of-community hate word usage as a proxy for learned hate. We investigate
    four different Reddit subcommunities (subreddits) covering three areas of
    hate speech: racism, misogyny and fat-shaming. In all three cases we ﬁnd an
    increase in hate speech outside the originating community, implying that
    joining such community leads to a spread of hate speech throughout the
    platform. Moreover, users are found to pick up this new hateful speech for
    months after initially joining the community. We show that the harmful
    speech does not remain contained within the community. Our results provide
    new evidence of the harmful effects of echo chambers and the potential
    beneﬁt of moderating them to reduce adoption of hateful speech.

  abstract: >-
    "Economists have long based their forecasts on financial aggregates such as
    price-earnings ratios, asset prices, and exchange rate fluctuations, and
    used them to produce statistically informed speculations about the
    future--with limited success. Robert Shiller employs such aggregates in his
    own forecasts, but has famously complemented them with observations about
    the influence of mass psychology on certain events. This approach has come
    to be known as behavioral economics. How can economists effectively capture
    the effects of psychology and its influence on economic events and change?
    Shiller attempts to help us better understand how psychology affects events
    by explaining how popular economic stories arise, how they grow viral, and
    ultimately how they drive economic developments. After defining narrative
    economics in the book's preface with allusions to the advent of both the
    Great Depression and to World War II, Shiller presents an example of a
    recent economic narrative gone viral in the story of Bitcoin. Next, he
    explains how narrative economics works with reference to how other
    disciplines incorporate narrative into their analyses and also to how
    epidemiology explains how disease goes viral. He then presents accounts of
    recurring economic narratives, including the gold standard, real estate
    booms, war and depression, and stock market booms and crashes. He ends his
    book with a blueprint for future research by economists on narrative
    economics"--

    Terrorist incidents are not random in space or time. Understanding the
    current spatial and temporal patterns of terrorist incidents, as well as
    predicting future trends, is vital for effective counterterrorist efforts.
    This article focuses on terrorist incidents in Iraq, which are defined here
    as attacks, both successful and unsuccessful, in order to detect patterns in
    the establishment of terrorist activity spaces. Using Geographic Information
    Science (GISc), this project carries out a series of spatial and temporal

  abstract: >-
    The current study provides a diachronic analysis of the stereotypical
    portrayals concerning seven of the most prominent foreign nationalities
    living in Spain in a Spanish news outlet. We use 12 years (2007-2018) of
    news articles to train word embedding models to quantify the association of
    such outgroups with drug use, prostitution, crimes, and poverty concepts.
    Then, we investigate the effects of sociopolitical variables on the computed
    bias series, such as the outgroup size in the host country and the rate of
    the population receiving unemployment beneﬁts. Our ﬁndings indicate that the
    texts exhibit bias against foreign-born people, especially in the case of
    outgroups for which the country of origin has a lower Gross Domestic Product
    per capita (PPP) than Spain.

    How much sex are people really having? How many Americans are actually
    racist? Is America experiencing a hidden back-alley abortion crisis? Can you
    game the stock market? Does violent entertainment increase the rate of
    violent crime? Do parents treat sons differently from daughters? How many
    people actually read the books they buy? In this work, Seth
    Stephens-Davidowitz, a Harvard-trained economist, former Google data
    scientist, and New York Times writer, argues that much of what we thought
    about people has been dead wrong. The reason? People lie, to friends,
    lovers, doctors, surveys -- and themselves. However, we no longer need to
    rely on what people tell us. New data from the internet -- the traces of
    information that billions of people leave on Google, social media, dating,
    and even pornography sites -- finally reveals the truth. By analyzing this
    digital goldmine, we can now learn what people really think, what they
    really want, and what they really do. Sometimes the new data will make you
    laugh out loud. Sometimes the new data will shock you. Sometimes the new
    data will deeply disturb you. But, always, this new data will make you
    think.--

    In this overview, we discuss the current state of survey methodology in a
    form that is useful and informative to a general social science audience.
    The article covers existing challenges, dilemmas, and opportunities for
    survey researchers and social scientists. We draw on the most current
    research to articulate our points; however, we also speculate on both
    technological and cultural changes that currently influence or may soon
    affect the efficacy of different methodological choices.

  abstract: >-
    There seems to be a great deal of attention in the media given to global
    terrorism but the authors do not know what and where the actual risks are.
    Western countries such as Australia, UK, and USA have invested a great
    amount of financial resources to combat global terrorism yet there is a
    concern the investments outweigh the risk. Furthermore, there are some
    people who question the reality of global terrorism. To explore these
    issues, this study analyzes the global terrorism empirical evidence from
    1970 to 2013 (2014 was still in progress). The goal was to describe the
    global terrorist behavior factors and patterns from a socio-economical
    perspective, to identify who the terrorist groups are, what they do, and
    where they attack. Interesting descriptive statistics and insights were
    provided to help practitioners understand how global terrorism impacts us
    and to motive more empirical into this important topic.

    The aim of this paper is to discuss the usefulness of social conflict theory
    as a theoretical framework for analyzing the conflict in Northern Ireland.
    The social conflict theories under consideration are Lewis Coser's
    functionalist theory of conflict, Ralf Dahrendorf's theory, and Randall
    Collins' sociology of conflict. The main question is whether social conflict
    theories provide a useful analytical tool in understanding ethnic conflicts:
    their nature, bases, and the actions of the social actors involved.

  abstract: "Bryan Pintado Sánchez, de 22 años, e Inti Sotelo Camargo, de 24 años, fallecieron el sábado 14 último durante las manifestaciones de protesta contra el gobierno de Manuel Merino, en el centro de Lima, cuando efectivos policiales reprimieron a la multitud congregada entre el Parque Universitario y la Plaza San Martín.\n\nSus muertes precipitaron la renuncia de Manuel Merino a la Presidencia de la República, el domingo pasado, y han conmovido a todo el país, que se ha solidarizado con los familiares de los jóvenes.\n\nLa necropsia de los cuerpos ha confirmado que ambos manifestantes perdieron la vida por graves heridas causadas por impactos de armas de fuego.\_\n\nBryan Pintado recibió 11 disparos de perdigones que dañaron su cráneo, cara, cuello, brazos y tórax. En el caso de Inti Sotelo, se halló cuatro impactos de perdigones cerca al corazón, que habrían ocasionado su muerte.\_\n\_\nAl respecto, el Ministerio Público ha iniciado dos investigaciones preliminares: una al expresidente Manuel Merino, al expremier Ántero Flores-Aráoz y al exministro del Interior, Gastón Rodriguez, por el delito de homicidio culposo; y otra, contra los que resulten responsables, por homicidio en el contexto de graves violaciones de derechos humanos.\n\nEn este pódcast de Convoca\_Radio, conoce a los llamados “héroes del bicentenario”, cuyas muertes contribuyeron al retorno del país al cauce de la democracia, la cual fue interrumpida por 105 congresistas que destituyeron de la presidencia a Martín Vizcarra y, así, colocaron a Manuel Merino como jefe de Estado. Los familiares de Bryan e Inti exigen justicia."

    This article reviews the political science literature on political violence
    against civilians, including genocide, mass killing, and terrorism. Early
    work on these subjects tended to portray this kind of violence as
    irrational, random, or the result of ancient hatreds between ethnic groups.
    Most scholars studying political violence today, however, understand it to
    be primarily, if not exclusively, instrumental and orchestrated by powerful
    actors seeking to achieve tangible political or military objectives.
    Scholars continue to disagree, however, about the specific motives that
    drive belligerents to target civilians or the conditions under which
    large-scale violence against civilians is most likely.

    The goal of this book is to put an array of tools at the fingertips of
    students, practitioners, and researchers by explaining approaches long used
    by survey statisticians, illustrating how existing software can be used to
    solve survey problems, and developing some specialized software where
    needed. This volume serves at least three audiences: (1) students of applied
    sampling techniques; 2) practicing survey statisticians applying concepts
    learned in theoretical or applied sampling courses; and (3) social
    scientists and other survey practitioners who design, select, and weight
    survey samples. The text thoroughly covers fundamental aspects of survey
    sampling, such as sample size calculation (with examples for both single-
    and multi-stage sample design) and weight computation, accompanied by
    software examples to facilitate implementation. Features include
    step-by-step instructions for calculating survey weights, extensive
    real-world examples and applications, and representative programming code in
    R, SAS, and other packages. Since the publication of the first edition in

  abstract: >-
    Social scientists usually assume that the attitudes, behaviors, and statuses
    of respondents to longitudinal surveys are not altered by the act of
    measuring them. If this assumption is false—or even if the quality of survey
    participants’ responses change because of measurement—then social scientists
    risk mischaracterizing the existence, magnitude, and correlates of changes
    across survey waves in respondents’ characteristics. In this article, we
    make the case that social scientists ought to worry more about panel
    conditioning biases. We also describe and demonstrate empirical strategies
    for estimating the magnitude of such biases in longitudinal surveys, and we
    provide illustrative empirical results that are germane to social science
    research. We end by outlining a research agenda that would generate specific
    information about the nature and degree of panel conditioning in specific
    longitudinal surveys as well as a broader understanding of the circumstances
    in which panel conditioning is most likely to occur.

  abstract: >-
    Tobler's first law (TFL) of geography was introduced into the geographical
    literature in an article that Waldo Tobler published in the journal Economic
    Geography in 1970. In this article, which described a simulation of
    population growth in Detroit, Tobler stated that to make his model
    operational he would “invoke the first law of geography: everything is
    related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant
    things.” This entry considers whether TFL is an accurate description of the
    real world. Specifically, it considers the following questions: Is TFL
    really a law and, if so, is it the most important law in Geography? Do
    modern spatial interpolation techniques allow the model to be
    operationalized? How can “near” and “distant” be measured? Is it true for
    Euclidean and network space? Do classic models of human and urban geography
    conform to TFL?

  abstract: >-
    Economists are shifting resources from work on survey data to work involving
    “Big Data.” This analysis is an empirical exploration of the trade-oﬀs this
    substitution requires. Parallel models are estimated using Equifax credit
    bureau data and Survey of Consumer Finances data. After adjustments to
    account for diﬀerent variable deﬁnitions and sampled populations, it is
    possible to arrive at similar models of total household debt. However, the
    estimates are sensitive to the adjustments. In this example, some external
    education and income measures are successfully integrated with the big data,
    but other external aggregates fail to adequately substitute for survey
    responses.

    "This book provides a perspective on the application of machine
    learning-based methods in knowledge discovery from natural languages texts.
    By analysing various data sets, conclusions, which are not normally evident,
    emerge and can be used for various purposes and applications. The book
    provides explanations of principles of time-proven machine learning
    algorithms applied in text mining together with step-by-step demonstrations
    of how to reveal the semantic contents in real-world datasets using the
    popular R-language with its implemented machine learning algorithms. The
    book is not only aimed at IT specialists, but is meant for a wider audience
    that needs to process big sets of text documents and has basic knowledge of
    the subject, e.g. e-mail service providers, online shoppers, librarians,

    Random-digit dialing (RDD) telephone surveys are challenged by declining
    response rates and increasing costs. Many surveys that were traditionally
    conducted via telephone are seeking cost-effective alternatives, such as
    address-based sampling (ABS) with self-administered web or mail
    questionnaires. At a fraction of the cost of both telephone and ABS surveys,
    opt-in web panels are an attractive alternative. The 2019–2020 National
    Alcohol Survey (NAS) employed three methods: (1) an RDD telephone survey
    (traditional NAS method); (2) an ABS push-to-web survey; and (3) an opt-in
    web panel. The study reported here evaluated differences in the three
    data-collection methods, which we will refer to as “mode effects,” on
    alcohol consumption and health topics. To evaluate mode effects,
    multivariate regression models were developed predicting these
    characteristics, and the presence of a mode effect on each outcome was
    determined by the significance of the three-level effect (RDD-telephone,
    ABS-web, opt-in web panel) in each model. Those results were then used to
    adjust for mode effects and produce a “telephone-equivalent” estimate for
    the ABS and panel data sources. The study found that ABS-web and RDD were
    similar for most estimates but exhibited differences for sensitive questions
    including getting drunk and experiencing depression. The opt-in web panel
    exhibited more differences between it and the other two survey modes. One
    notable example is the reporting of drinking alcohol at least 3–4 times per
    week, which was 21 percent for RDD-phone, 24 percent for ABS-web, and 34
    percent for opt-in web panel. The regression model adjusts for mode effects,
    improving comparability with past surveys conducted by telephone; however,
    the models result in higher variance of the estimates. This method of
    adjusting for mode effects has broad applications to mode and sample
    transitions throughout the survey research industry.
