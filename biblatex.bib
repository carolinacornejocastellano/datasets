We first discuss how a focus on status hierarchies differs from, complements, and extends the traditional focus on individual-­level status positions. Drawing on a range of empirical case studies, we then identify three architectural features of status hierarchies—variations in their verticality, the clarity of their distinctions, and their rigidity—that affect the extent of inequality in the rewards received by the incumbents of high versus low status positions. We conclude by highlighting promising research questions and hypotheses that this macroscopic, status hierarchies approach raises.},

En particular, se intenta demostrar que el uso de terruco como un insulto, aunque en principio dirigido a los miembros de los grupos alzados en armas, contribuyó decisivamente, durante los años de la guerra sucia e incluso en tiempos más recientes, a estigmatizar a distintos sectores de la población peruana, incluyendo a defensores de derechos humanos, familiares de detenidos y otras víctimas de la violencia política, y personas de origen indígena en general. Su uso recurrente en sesiones de tortura y en episodios de violación sexual añade una dimensión adicional a la conexión entre el término terruco y la práctica generalizada de formas de abuso y violencia que fueron consideradas, por muchos peruanos, necesarias y hasta legítimas durante los años del conflicto armado interno 				,},

  abstract = {Abstract             While Big Data offers a potentially less expensive, less burdensome, and more timely alternative to survey data for producing a variety of statistics, it is not without error. The AAPOR Task Force on Big Data and others have called for researchers to evaluate the quality of Big Data using an approach similar to the total survey error (TSE) framework. However, differences in the construction of, access to, and overall data structure between survey data and Big Data make application of TSE difficult. In this article, we seek to develop the Total Error Framework (TEF), an extension of the TSE framework, to be (1) more inclusive and applicable to many types of Big Data, (2) comprehensive in that it considers “total” error, and (3) unified in that it allows researchers to compare errors in Big Data to errors in survey data. After outlining this framework, we then illustrate an application of TEF by comparing error in housing unit area (square footage) estimates collected in a survey (the 2015 Residential Energy Consumption Survey [RECS]) to those estimates found in three Big Data databases (Zillow.com, Acxiom, and CoreLogic).},

  abstract = {Regionalization is a classification procedure applied to spatial objects with an areal representation, which groups them into homogeneous contiguous regions. This paper presents an efficient method for regionalization. The first step creates a connectivity graph that captures the neighbourhood relationship between the spatial objects. The cost of each edge in the graph is inversely proportional to the similarity between the regions it joins. We summarize the neighbourhood structure by a minimum spanning tree (MST), which is a connected tree with no circuits. We partition the MST by successive removal of edges that link dissimilar regions. The result is the division of the spatial objects into connected regions that have maximum internal homogeneity. Since the MST partitioning problem is NP‐hard, we propose a heuristic to speed up the tree partitioning significantly. Our results show that our proposed method combines performance and quality, and it is a good alternative to other regionalization methods found in the literature.},

Economists also assume that we're doing the very best we can possibly do - not only for today, but over our whole lifetimes too. But increasingly the study of behavioural economics is revealing that our lives are not that simple. Instead, our decisions are complicated by our own psychology. Each of us makes mistakes every day. We don't always know what's best for us and, even if we do, we might not have the self-control to deliver on our best intentions. We struggle to stay on diets, to get enough exercise and to manage our money. We misjudge risky situations. We are prone to herding: sometimes peer pressure leads us blindly to copy others around us; other times copying others helps us to learn quickly about new, unfamiliar situations. 00This Very Short Introduction explores the reasons why we make irrational decisions; how we decide quickly; why we make mistakes in risky situations; our tendency to procrastination; and how we are affected by social influences, personality, mood and emotions},

In a 109-country online experiment, we convey information on interaction partners’ nationalities to indicate membership in a broader in- or out-group, cultural distance, and perceived material neediness—or status differences more generally—to 1,674 participants in incentivized games of generosity (dictator game) and trust (trust game). We find consistent evidence for in-group favoritism and—against this benchmark—demonstrate that individuals across the globe share more with but place less trust in interaction partners from poor countries and that cultural distance moderates this status effect.},

  abstract = {We estimated ideological preferences of 3.8 million Twitter users and, using a data set of nearly 150 million tweets concerning 12 political and nonpolitical issues, explored whether online communication resembles an “echo chamber” (as a result of selective exposure and ideological segregation) or a “national conversation.” We observed that information was exchanged primarily among individuals with similar ideological preferences in the case of political issues (e.g., 2012 presidential election, 2013 government shutdown) but not many other current events (e.g., 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, 2014 Super Bowl). Discussion of the Newtown shootings in 2012 reflected a dynamic process, beginning as a national conversation before transforming into a polarized exchange. With respect to both political and nonpolitical issues, liberals were more likely than conservatives to engage in cross-ideological dissemination; this is an important asymmetry with respect to the structure of communication that is consistent with psychological theory and research bearing on ideological differences in epistemic, existential, and relational motivation. Overall, we conclude that previous work may have overestimated the degree of ideological segregation in social-media usage.},

  abstract = {Guidelines for designing information charts often state that the presentation should reduce ‗chart junk‘ – visual embellishments that are not essential to understanding the data. In contrast, some popular chart designers wrap the presented data in detailed and elaborate imagery, raising the questions of whether this imagery is really as detrimental to understanding as has been proposed, and whether the visual embellishment may have other benefits. To investigate these issues, we conducted an experiment that compared embellished charts with plain ones, and measured both interpretation accuracy and long-term recall. We found that people‘s accuracy in describing the embellished charts was no worse than for plain charts, and that their recall after a two-to-three-week gap was significantly better. Although we are cautious about recommending that all charts be produced in this style, our results question some of the premises of the minimalist approach to chart design.},

  author = {Baxter, M J},
  date = {2015},
  abstract = {In archaeological applications involving the spatial clustering of two-dimensional spatial data kmeans cluster analysis has proved to be a popular method for over 40 years. There are alternatives to k-means analysis which can be thought of as either ‘competitive’ or ‘complementary’ such as k-medoids, model-based clustering, fuzzy clustering and density based clustering among many possibilities. Most of these have been little used in archaeology. That k-means has been a method of choice is probably because it is readily understood, is perceived as being geared to archaeological needs, and was rendered accessible at a time when computational resources were limited compared to what is now available. It is, in fact, a long-established approach to clustering that pre-dates archaeological interest in it by some years. The theses of the present paper are that (a) other methods are available that potentially improve on what is possible with k-means; (b) these are (mostly) as readily understood as k-means; (c) they are now as easy to implement as k-means is; and (d) merit more attention than they have received from practitioners who find k-means useful. The arguments are illustrated by extensive application to a data set that has been the subject of several previous studies.},

  abstract = {Cognitive interviewing has emerged as one of the more prominent methods for identifying and correcting problems with survey questions. We define cognitive interviewing as the administration of draft survey questions while collecting additional verbal information about the survey responses, which is used to evaluate the quality of the response or to help determine whether the question is generating the information that its author intends. But beyond this general categorization, cognitive interviewing potentially includes a variety of activities that may be based on different assumptions about the type of data that are being collected and the role of the interviewer in that process. This synthesis reviews the range of current cognitive interviewing practices, focusing on three considerations: (1) what are the dominant paradigms of cognitive interviewing—what is produced under each, and what are their apparent advantages; (2) what key decisions about cognitive interview study design need to be made once the general approach is selected (e.g., who should be interviewed, how many interviews should be conducted, and how should probes be selected), and what bases exist for making these decisions; and (3) how cognitive interviewing data should be evaluated, and what standards of evidence exist for making questionnaire design decisions based on study findings. In considering these issues, we highlight where standards for best practices are not clearly defined, and suggest broad areas worthy of additional methodological research.},

But even given the long history of polling, there is no agreement among political scientists on how to best measure public opinion through polls. This article is a call for political scientists to be more self-conscious about the choices we make when we attempt to measure public opinion with surveys in two realms. I first take up the question of whom to interview, discussing the major challenges survey researchers face when sampling respondents from the population of interest. I then discuss the level of specificity with which we can properly collect information about the political preferences of individuals. I focus on the types of question wording and item aggregation strategies researchers can use to accurately measure public opinion.},

Victim race, threat level, and visibility affect the likelihood that an officer-involved death will mobilize political interest. Political interest and voter turnout are higher among the treatment group, which was exposed to high-visibility/low-threat Black victims only before participating in the CMPS, than in the control group, which was exposed to such victims only after taking the survey. Exposing young Black respondents to all victims without accounting for threat, visibility, or race does not affect political interest or voter turnout, suggesting the importance of these factors for mobilization. The findings clarify the role that Black Lives Matter activists, journalists, and watchdog groups can play in countering the police actions that shape the visibility and framing of Black victims of police violence.},

The policy scenarios target (i) organized crime leaders and (ii) facilitators for imprisonment, (iii) provide educational and welfare support to children and their mothers while separating them from organized-crime fathers, and (iv) increase educational and social support to at-risk schoolchildren.                                         Methods               We developed a novel agent-based model drawing on theories of peer effects (differential association, social learning), social embeddedness of organized crime, and the general theory of crime. Agents are simultaneously embedded in multiple social networks (household, kinship, school, work, friends, and co-offending) and possess heterogeneous individual attributes. Relational and individual attributes determine the probability of offending. Co-offending with organized crime members determines recruitment into the criminal group. All the main parameters are calibrated on data from Palermo or Sicily (Italy). We test the effect of the four policy scenarios against a baseline no-intervention scenario on the number of newly recruited and total organized crime members using Generalized Estimating Equations models.                                         Results               The simulations generate realistic outcomes, with relatively stable organized crime membership and crime rates. All simulated policy interventions reduce the total number of members, whereas all but primary socialization reduce newly recruited members. The intensity of the effects, however, varies across dependent variables and models.                                         Conclusions               Agent-based models effectively enable to develop theoretically driven and empirically calibrated simulations of organized crime. The simulations can fill the gaps in evaluation research in the field of organized crime and allow us to test different policies in different environmental contexts.},

  abstract = {Capturing dynamics of operational similarity among terrorist groups is critical to provide actionable insights for counter-terrorism and intelligence monitoring. Yet, in spite of its theoretical and practical relevance, research addressing this problem is currently lacking. We tackle this problem proposing a novel computational framework for detecting clusters of terrorist groups sharing similar behaviors, focusing on groups’ yearly repertoire of deployed tactics, attacked targets, and utilized weapons. Specifically considering those organizations that have plotted at least 50 attacks from 1997 to 2018, accounting for a total of 105 groups responsible for more than 42,000 events worldwide, we offer three sets of results. First, we show that over the years global terrorism has been characterized by increasing operational cohesiveness. Second, we highlight that year-to-year stability in co-clustering among groups has been particularly high from 2009 to 2018, indicating temporal consistency of similarity patterns in the last decade. Third, we demonstrate that operational similarity between two organizations is driven by three factors: (a) their overall activity; (b) the difference in the diversity of their operational repertoires; (c) the difference in a combined measure of diversity and activity. Groups’ operational preferences, geographical homophily and ideological affinity have no consistent role in determining operational similarity.},

  abstract = {Background:               While clinical medicine has exploded, electronic health records for Natural Language Processing (NLP) analyses, public health, and health policy research have not yet adopted these algorithms. We aimed to dissect the health chapters of the government plans of the 2016 and 2021 Peruvian presidential elections, and to compare different NLP algorithms.                                         Methods:               From the government plans (18 in 2016; 19 in 2021) we extracted each sentence from the health chapters. We used five NLP algorithms to extract keywords and phrases from each plan: Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), TextRank, Keywords Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (KeyBERT), and Rapid Automatic Keywords Extraction (Rake).                                         Results:               In 2016 we analysed 630 sentences, whereas in 2021 there were 1,685 sentences. The TF-IDF algorithm showed that in 2016, 26 terms appeared with a frequency of 0.08 or greater, while in 2021 27 terms met this criterion. The LDA algorithm defined two groups. The first included terms related to things the population would receive (e.g., ’insurance’), while the second included terms about the health system (e.g., ’capacity’). In 2021, most of the government plans belonged to the second group. The TextRank analysis provided keywords showing that ’universal health coverage’ appeared frequently in 2016, while in 2021 keywords about the COVID-19 pandemic were often found. The KeyBERT algorithm provided keywords based on the context of the text. These keywords identified some underlying characteristics of the political party (e.g., political spectrum such as left-wing). The Rake algorithm delivered phrases, in which we found ’universal health coverage’ in 2016 and 2021.                                         Conclusion:               The NLP analysis could be used to inform on the underlying priorities in each government plan. NLP analysis could also be included in research of health policies and politics during general elections and provide informative summaries for the general population.},

  abstract = {This paper contributes to the ongoing discussions on the scholarly access to social media data, discussing a case where this access is barred despite its value for understanding and countering online disinformation and despite the absence of privacy or copyright issues. Our study concerns YouTube’s engagement metrics and, more specifically, the way in which the platform removes "fake views" (i.e., views considered as artificial or illegitimate by the platform). Working with one and a half year of data extracted from a thousand French YouTube channels, we show the massive extent of this phenomenon, which concerns the large majority of the channels and more than half the videos in our corpus. Our analysis indicates that most fakes news are corrected relatively late in the life of the videos and that the final view counts of the videos are not independent from the fake views they received. We discuss the potential harm that delays in corrections could produce in content diffusion: by inflating views counts, illegitimate views could make a video appear more popular than it is and unwarrantedly encourage its human and algorithmic recommendation. Unfortunately, we cannot offer a definitive assessment of this phenomenon, because YouTube provides no information on fake views in its API or interface. This paper is, therefore, also a call for greater transparency by YouTube and other online platforms about information that can have crucial implications for the quality of online public debate.},

New social movements, technologies, and public-health initiatives often struggle to take off, yet many diseases disperse rapidly without issue. Can the lessons learned from the viral diffusion of diseases be used to improve the spread of beneficial behaviors and innovations? In How Behavior Spreads, Damon Centola presents over a decade of original research examining how changes in societal behavior--in voting, health, technology, and finance--occur and the ways social networks can be used to influence how they propagate. Centola's startling findings show that the same conditions accelerating the viral expansion of an epidemic unexpectedly inhibit the spread of behaviors. While it is commonly believed that "weak ties"--long-distance connections linking acquaintances--lead to the quicker spread of behaviors, in fact the exact opposite holds true. Centola demonstrates how the most well-known, intuitive ideas about social networks have caused past diffusion efforts to fail, and how such efforts might succeed in the future. Pioneering the use of Web-based methods to understand how changes in people's social networks alter their behaviors, Centola illustrates the ways in which these insights can be applied to solve countless problems of organizational change, cultural evolution, and social innovation. His findings offer important lessons for public health workers, entrepreneurs, and activists looking to harness networks for social change.Practical and informative, How Behavior Spreads is a must-read for anyone interested in how the theory of social networks can transform our world"--Provided by publisher},

The first few chapters will teach you how to set up your own data analysis project in RStudio, acquire data from different data sources, and manipulate and clean data for analysis and visualization purposes. You'll get hands-on with various data visualization methods using ggplot2, and you will create interactive and multidimensional visualizations with D3.js. Additional recipes will help you optimize your code; implement various statistical models to manage large datasets; perform text analysis and predictive analysis; and master time series analysis, machine learning, forecasting; and so on. In the final few chapters..},

  abstract = {"We are in an age of big data where all of our everyday interactions and transactions generate data. Much of this data is spatial - it is collected some-where - and identifying analytical insight from trends and patterns in these increasing rich digital footprints presents a number of challenges. These include the questioning of classical statistical hypothesis testing (with Big Data almost everything is significant), the importance of data visualizations to support robust hypothesis development and the role of spatial data analytics to link different big spatial datasets and to support trend identification. This book builds on the tools and techniques described in An Introduction to R for Spatial Analysis and Mapping by Brunsdon and Comber, extending these into Big Spatial Data and Data Analytics. It reflects a number of recent developments in both thinking about Big Spatial Data and in handling such data in R, the open source statistical software, which have significantly increased R's ability to handle, process and visualize big data. As yet there are no text books which reflect these recent developments in data handling in R, that develop robust inferential methods for Big Data analysis, that include spatial operations in data analytics or that describe advanced spatial manipulations and visualizations of highly dimensional, spatially referenced data. This book addresses these gaps"--},

  abstract = {We study learning on social media with an equilibrium model of users interacting with shared news stories. Rational users arrive sequentially and each observes an original story (i.e., a private signal) and a sample of predecessors’ stories in a news feed, then decides which stories to share. The observed sample of stories depends on what predecessors share as well as the sampling algorithm, which represents a design choice of the platform. We focus on how much the algorithm relies on virality (how many times a story has been previously shared) when generating news feeds. Showing users more viral stories can increase information aggregation, but it can also generate steady states where most shared stories are wrong. Such misleading steady states selfperpetuate, as users who observe these wrong stories develop wrong beliefs, and thus rationally continue to share them. We find that these bad steady states appear discontinuously, and even a benevolent platform designer either accepts these misleading steady states or induces fragile learning outcomes in the optimal design.},

Various games are considered, which produce different kinds of opinion formation dynamics. First, by assuming that all individuals (players) are equals, we obtain the bounded confidence model of continuous opinion dynamics proposed by Deffuant et al. In such a model a tolerance threshold is defined, such that individuals with difference in opinion larger than the threshold can not interact. Then, we consider that the individuals have different inclinations to change opinion and different abilities in convincing the others. In this way, we obtain the so-called "Stubborn individuals and Orators" (SO) model, a generalization of the Deffuant et al. model, in which the threshold tolerance is different for every couple of individuals. We explore, by numerical simulations, the dynamics of the SO model, and we propose further generalizations that can be implemented.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT What does the American public label as “terrorism?” How do people think about the factors motivating violence, and in turn, the policies that are favored? Using ingroup and outgroup dynamics, we argue that the terrorist label is more readily applied to Arab-Americans than Whites, and to members of militant groups. Moreover, people attribute different motives to violence committed by Arabs versus Whites, and favor different policies in response. We conducted an experiment where we randomly assigned one of six stories about a failed armed attack, each with a different combination of ethnicity and group affiliation. We find that an Arab ethnicity and Islamist group affiliation increase the likelihood of labeling an act as terrorism. Attacks by Whites and members of a White supremacist group are less likely to be labeled terrorism. Rather, Whites are more likely to be called “mass shooters.” Despite never discussing motive, Arab-American attackers are more likely to be ascribed political or religious motives, while White suspects are more likely to be seen as mentally ill. Lastly, an Arab ethnicity increases support for counterterrorism policies and decreases support for mental health care.},

  abstract = {In a high-choice media environment, there are fears that individuals will select media and content that reinforce their existing beliefs and lead to segregation based on interest and/or partisanship. This could lead to partisan echo chambers among those who are politically interested and could contribute to a growing gap in knowledge between those who are politically interested and those who are not. However, the high-choice environment also allows individuals, including those who are politically interested, to consume a wide variety of media, which could lead them to more diverse content and perspectives. This study examines the relationship between political interest as well as media diversity and being caught in an echo chamber (measured by five different variables). Using a nationally representative survey of adult internet users in the United Kingdom (N = 2000), we find that those who are interested in politics and those with diverse media diets tend to avoid echo chambers. This work challenges the impact of echo chambers and tempers fears of partisan segregation since only a small segment of the population are likely to find themselves in an echo chamber. We argue that single media studies and studies which use narrow definitions and measurements of being in an echo chamber are flawed because they do not test the theory in the realistic context of a multiple media environment.},

  abstract = {External validity of randomized experiments is a focus of long-standing debates in the social sciences. While the issue has been extensively studied at the conceptual level, in practice, few empirical studies have explicit analysis aimed towards externally valid inferences. In this article, we make three contributions to improve empirical approaches for external validity. First, we propose a formal framework that encompasses four dimensions of external validity; X-, T -, Y -, and C-validity (units, treatments, outcomes, and contexts). The proposed framework synthesizes diverse external validity concerns that arise in practice. We then distinguish two goals of generalization. To conduct effect-generalization —generalizing the magnitude of causal effects, we introduce three estimators of the target population causal effects. For sign-generalization — assessing whether the direction of causal effects is generalizable, we propose a novel multiple-testing procedure under weaker assumptions. We illustrate our methods through three applications covering field, survey, and lab experiments.},

  abstract = {How do protest actions impact public support for social movements? Here we test the claim that extreme protest actions—protest behaviors perceived to be harmful to others, highly disruptive, or both—typically reduce support for social movements. Across 6 experiments, including 3 that were preregistered, participants indicated less support for social movements that used more extreme protest actions. This result obtained across a variety of movements (e.g., animal rights, anti-Trump, anti-abortion) and extreme protest actions (e.g., blocking highways, vandalizing property). Further, in 5 of 6 studies, negative reactions to extreme protest actions also led participants to support the movement’s central cause less, and these effects were largely independent of individuals’ prior ideology or views on the issue. In all studies we found effects were driven by diminished social identification with the movement. In Studies 4 – 6, serial mediation analyses detailed a more in-depth model: observers viewed extreme protest actions to be immoral, reducing observers’ emotional connection to the movement and, in turn, reducing identification with and support for the movement. Taken together with prior research showing that extreme protest actions can be effective for applying pressure to institutions and raising awareness of movements, these findings suggest an activist’s dilemma, in which the same protest actions that may offer certain benefits are also likely to undermine popular support for social movements.},

  abstract = {The most widespread method of computing confidence intervals (CIs) in complex surveys is to add and subtract the margin of error (MOE) from the point estimate, where the MOE is the estimated standard error multiplied by the suitable Gaussian quantile. This Wald-type interval is used by the American Community Survey (ACS), the largest US household sample survey. For inferences on small proportions with moderate sample sizes, this method often results in marked under-coverage and lower CI endpoint less than 0. We assess via simulation the coverage and width, in complex sample surveys, of seven alternatives to the Wald interval for a binomial proportion with sample size replaced by the ‘effective sample size,’ that is, the sample size divided by the design effect. Building on previous work by the present authors, our simulations address the impact of clustering, stratification, different stratum sampling fractions, and stratum-specific proportions. We show that all intervals undercover when there is clustering and design effects are computed from a simple design-based estimator of sampling variance. Coverage can be better calibrated for the alternatives to Wald by improving estimation of the effective sample size through superpopulation modeling. This approach is more effective in our simulations than previously proposed modifications of effective sample size. We recommend intervals of the Wilson or Bayes uniform prior form, with the Jeffreys prior interval not far behind.},

To help researchers address this problem in the context of their own studies, we recommend design calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate being in the wrong direction (Type S [sign] error) and (b) the factor by which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated (Type M [magnitude] error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We illustrate with examples from recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on external information.},

This article examines attitudes towards the violence perpetrated by police officers against protesters and the violence carried out by protesters against police officers in the context of the post-social outbreak of October 18, 2019 in Chile. We evaluate the role played by the perception of injustice in the procedures and the treatment of police officers towards protesters, the evaluation of the legitimacy of police officers and group identification with protesters and police officers in predicting the justification of violence. We present the results of a survey on legitimacy and police violence carried out among adults in Chile during January 2021 (n = 2,717). Through a Path Analysis, we found that the perception of injustice in the procedures through which the police treat protesters is a key factor in predicting the perception of legitimacy of the police, especially among people who identify with the protesters. Furthermore, by reducing the legitimacy of the police, the perception of injustice in the procedures and the treatment translates into lower levels of justification of police violence and to greater levels of justification of protestor violence. The article finishes by highlighting the importance of considering the perceptions of injustice in the procedures and treatment of police officers in order to reduce the conflict between police officers and protesters in Chile.},

  abstract = {Fiscal rules are laws aimed at reducing the incentive to accumulate debt, and many countries adopt them to discipline local governments. Yet, their effectiveness is disputed because of commitment and enforcement problems. We study their impact applying a quasi-experimental design in Italy. In 1999, the central government imposed fiscal rules on municipal governments, and in 2001 relaxed them below 5,000 inhabitants. We exploit the before/after and discontinuous policy variation, and show that relaxing fiscal rules increases deficits and lowers taxes. The effect is larger if the mayor can be reelected, the number of parties is higher, and voters are older. (JEL E62, H71, H72, H74, R51)},

This type of evaluation rests on the assumption that the census-derived population accurately reflects the population at risk to be stopped. For vehicle stops, existing research indicates that this assumption is very problematic, resulting in highly unreliable assessments of black-white policing disparities. However, there is little research on the significance of this assumption for stopped urban pedestrians. Analyzing more than 100,000 investigatory stops in Chicago, the present study finds that similar to vehicle stops, most pedestrian investigations do not involve neighborhood residents, and estimates of racial disproportionality are inflated when this issue is ignored. Still, the degree to which estimates are inflated appears less than that previously reported for vehicle stops, and sizable racial disparities remain unexplained after the issue is taken into account. Implications for future research are discussed.},

  abstract = {Use of internet panels to collect survey data is increasing because it is cost-effective, enables access to large and diverse samples quickly, takes less time than traditional methods to obtain back for analysis, and the standardization of data collection process makes studies easy to replicate. A variety of probability-based panels have been created including Telepanel/CentERpanel, Knowledge Networks (now GFK KnowledgePanel®), the American Life Panel, the LISS Panel, and the Understanding American Study panel. Despite the advantage of having a known denominator (sampling frame), the probability-based internet panels often have low recruitment participation rates and some have argued that there is little practical difference between opting out of a probability sample and opting into a non-probability (convenience) internet panel. This paper provides an overview of both probability-based and convenience panels, discussing potential benefits and cautions for each method, and summarizing approaches used to weight panel respondents to better represent the underlying population. Challenges in using internet panel data such as false answers, careless responses, giving the same answer repeatedly, getting multiple surveys from the same respondent, and panelists being members of multiple panels are discussed. There is more to be learned about internet panels generally and web-based data collection along with opportunities to evaluate data collected using mobile devices and social media platforms.},

With its low cost and scalability, crowdsourcing presents an attractive option for evaluating the large design space of visualizations; however, it first requires validation. In this paper, we assess the viability of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk as a platform for graphical perception experiments. We replicate previous studies of spatial encoding and luminance contrast and compare our results. We also conduct new experiments on rectangular area perception (as in treemaps or cartograms) and on chart size and gridline spacing. Our results demonstrate that crowdsourced perception experiments are viable and contribute new insights for visualization design. Lastly, we report cost and performance data from our experiments and distill recommendations for the design of crowdsourced studies.},

  abstract = {Why do governments use deadly force against unarmed protesters? The government’s threat perception may be a function of the mobilization potential of the opposition and/or the size of the ruling elite’s support coalition. Given the high salience of ethnicity in African politics, governments that depend on small ethnic coalitions will see peaceful protests as more threatening, as the opposition may be able to draw on larger numbers of potential dissidents and excluded groups. Alternately, governments with larger, more homogeneous ethnic coalitions will find nonviolent mobilization less threatening and will be less likely to respond with deadly force. Using the Social Conflict Analysis Database, we demonstrate that as the size – and to a lesser extent homogeneity – of the ethnic ruling coalition grows, governments are significantly less likely to use deadly force against nonviolent protesters. This finding is robust to several operationalizations of the size of the government’s support coalition, the inclusion of other measures of ethnic demographics, and estimators that account for the hierarchical nature of the data. Threat perception hinges not only on dissident tactics but on their demands, their mobilization potential, and their capacity to impose costs on the government. This article demonstrates that the size and composition of the government’s ethnic support base matters as well.},

However, even staunch defenders of NHST agree that its outcomes are often misinterpreted. Confidence intervals (CIs) have frequently been proposed as a more useful alternative to NHST, and their use is strongly encouraged in the APA Manual. Nevertheless, little is known about how researchers interpret CIs. In this study, 120 researchers and 442 students—all in the field of psychology—were asked to assess the truth value of six particular statements involving different interpretations of a CI. Although all six statements were false, both researchers and students endorsed, on average, more than three statements, indicating a gross misunderstanding of CIs. Self-declared experience with statistics was not related to researchers’ performance, and, even more surprisingly, researchers hardly outperformed the students, even though the students had not received any education on statistical inference whatsoever. Our findings suggest that many researchers do not know the correct interpretation of a CI. The misunderstandings surrounding pvalues and CIs are particularly unfortunate because they constitute the main tools by which psychologists draw conclusions from data.},

  abstract = {Terrorist attacks are events which hinder the development of a region. Before the terrorist attacks, we need to conduct a graded evaluation of the terrorist attacks. After getting the level of terrorist attacks, we can fight terrorist organizations more effectively. This paper builds rating models for terrorist attacks, hidden or emerging terrorist organization classification discovery models, terrorist organization alliance network models and more, through quantitative research of the Global Terrorism Database, which solved the event classification. Through studying relevant literature and the variables of the Global Terrorism Database, this paper sorted out 25 observation variables related to the impact level (level of harm) of terrorist attacks. By establishing a mathematical model of factor analysis, 11 factors related to the impact level (level of harm) of terrorist attacks were constructed, and the variance of the contribution of each factor was used as the weight to calculate the comprehensive rate of the impact level of each terrorist attack. Finally, K-means clustering method is used to cluster and analyze the comprehensive rate of impact level, and the top 10 terrorist attacks with the highest impact level in the past two decades were obtained.},

  abstract = {Finite players allocate limited attention capacities between biased primary sources and the other players in order to gather information about an uncertain state. The resulting Poisson attention network transmits information from primary sources to a player either directly or indirectly through the other players. Rational inattention generates heterogeneous demands for information among players with heterogeneous preferences. In an echo-chamber equilibrium, each player restricts attention to his own-biased source and like-minded friends, who, by attending to the same primary source as his, serve as secondary sources in case the information transmission from the primary source to him is disrupted. We examine when and why echo-chamber equilibria would arise, and why a mandatory exposure of players to all biased sources could dissolve echo chambers but undermine welfare. We develop a new method for characterizing the opinion distribution within an echo chamber, establishing the law of the few even when the difference between players is minimal, and pointing to the controversy of policy interventions that augment the visibility of information sources.},

  abstract = {With the advancement of GPS and remote sensing technologies, large amounts of geospatial data are being collected from various domains, driving the need for effective and efficient prediction methods. Given spatial data samples with explanatory features and targeted responses (categorical or continuous) at a set of locations, the spatial prediction problem aims to learn a model that can predict the response variable based on explanatory features. The problem is important with broad applications in earth science, urban informatics, geosocial media analytics and public health, but is challenging due to the unique characteristics of spatial data, including spatial autocorrelation, heterogeneity, limited ground truth, and multiple scales and resolutions. This paper provides a systematic review on principles and methods in spatial prediction. We provide a taxonomy of methods categorized by the key challenge they address. For each method, we introduce its underlying assumption, theoretical foundation, and discuss its advantages and disadvantages. We also discuss spatiotemporal extensions of methods. Our goal is to help interdisciplinary domain scientists choose techniques to solve their problems, and more importantly, to help data mining researchers to understand the main principles and methods in spatial prediction and identify future research opportunities.},

Many reports, mostly by cyber security firms, regularly release information ranking the different nations in terms of top cyber crime output, broken down into varying cyber crime types. However, little has been done to classify nations according to separate cyber crime typologies using any multivariate methods. Instead, reporting is descriptive and unidimensional. The present research sought to fill this gap by conducting K-means clustering analysis on a sample of 190 countries using seven dimensions of cyber crime ranging from malware, fraud, spam, and digital piracy, as well as measures of GDP and internet use. The findings determined that nations can be broken down into four distinct categories based on cyber crime activity: low cyber crime countries, non-serious cyber crime countries, advance fee fraud countries, and phishing scam countries. The implications of these findings and the directions for future research are discussed.},

It is relatively new subfield of data mining which gained high popularity especially in geographie information scienees due to the pervasiveness of all kinds of location-based or environmental devices that record position, time or/and environmental properties of an object or set of objects in real-time. As a consequence, different types and large amounts of spatio-temporal data became available that introduce new challenges to data analysis and require novel approaches to knowledge discovery. In this chapter we concentrate on the spatio-temporal c1ustering in geographic space. First, we provide a c1assification of different types of spatio-temporal data. Then, we focus on one type of spatio-temporal c1ustering - trajectory c1ustering, provide an overview of the state-of-the-art approaches and methods of spatio-temporal c1ustering and finally present several scenarios in different application domains such as movement, ceIIular networks and environmental studies.},

  abstract = {Although it is well established that self-administered questionnaires tend to yield fewer reports in the socially desirable direction than do interviewer-administered questionnaires, less is known about whether different modes of self-administration vary in their effects on socially desirable responding. In addition, most mode comparison studies lack validation data and thus cannot separate the effects of differential nonresponse bias from the effects of differences in measurement error. This paper uses survey and record data to examine mode effects on the reporting of potentially sensitive information by a sample of recent university graduates. Respondents were randomly assigned to one of three modes of data collection—conventional computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI), interactive voice recognition (IVR), and the Web—and were asked about both desirable and undesirable attributes of their academic experiences. University records were used to evaluate the accuracy of the answers and to examine differences in nonresponse bias by mode. Web administration increased the level of reporting of sensitive information and reporting accuracy relative to conventional CATI, with IVR intermediate between the other two modes. Both mode of data collection and the actual status of the respondent influenced whether respondents found an item sensitive.},

Moving on, this book will teach you different dimensionality reduction techniques and their implementation in R. Next, we will cover pattern recognition in text data utilizing classification mechanisms, perform entity recognition, and develop an ontology learning framework. By the end of the book, you will develop a practical application from the concepts learned, and will understand how text mining can be leveraged to analyze the massively available data on social media." --Publisher's Description},

  abstract = {Terrorism is designed to change minds by destroying bodies; it is a form of costly signaling. Terrorists employ five primary strategies of costly signaling: attrition, intimidation, provocation, spoiling, and outbidding. The main targets of persuasion are the enemy and the population that the terrorists hope to represent or control. Terrorists wish to signal that they have the strength and will to impose costs on those who oppose them, and that the enemy and moderate groups on the terrorists' side cannot be trusted and should not be supported. Each strategy works well under certain conditions and poorly under others. State responses to one strategy may be inappropriate for other strategies. In some cases, however, terrorists are pursuing a combination of strategies, and the response must also work well against this combination.},

  abstract = {The author proposes a theory of social impact specifying the effect of other persons on an individual. According to the theory, when other people are the source of impact and the individual is the target, impact should be a multiplicative function of the strength, immediacy, and number of other people. Furthermore, impact should take the form of a power function, with the marginal effect of the Nth other person being less than that of the (N — l)th. Finally, when other people stand with the individual as the target of forces from outside the group, impact should be divided such that the resultant is an inverse power function of the strength, immediacy, and number of persons standing together. The author reviews relevant evidence from research on conformity and imitation, stage fright and embarrassment, news interest, bystander intervention, tipping, inquiring for Christ, productivity in groups, and crowding in rats. He also discusses the unresolved issues and desirable characteristics of the theory.},

  abstract = {Terrorist attacks have become a serious source of risk affecting the security of the international community. Using the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), in order to quantitatively study past terrorist attacks and their temporal and spatial evolution the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was used to classify the degree of damage from terrorist attacks. The various factors influencing terrorist attacks were extracted and represented in three dimensions. Subsequently, using MATLAB for analysis and processing, the grading standards for terrorist attacks were classified into five levels according to the degree of hazard. Based on this grading standard, the top ten terrorist attacks with the highest degree of hazard in the past two decades were listed. Because the characteristics and habits of a terrorist or group exhibit a certain consistency, the K-means cluster analysis method was used to classify terrorists according to region, type of attack, type of target and type of weapon used by the terrorists. Several attacks that might have been committed by the same terrorist organization or individual at different times and in different locations were classified into one category, and the top five categories were selected according to the degree of sabotage inflicted by the organization or individual. Finally, the spatiotemporal evolution of terrorist attacks in the past three years was analyzed, considering the terrorist attack targets and key areas of terrorist attacks. The Middle East, Southeast Asia, Central Asia, and Africa were predicted to be the regions that will be most seriously affected by future global terrorist events. The terrorist attacks in Southeast Asia are expected to become more severe, and the scope of terrorist attacks in Africa is expected to widen. Civilians are the targets most at risk for terrorist attacks, and the corresponding risk index is considerably higher than it is for other targets. The results of this research can help individuals and the government to enable a better understanding of terrorism, improve awareness to prevent terrorism and enhance emergency management and rescue, and provide a solid and reliable basis and reference for joint counterterrorism in various countries and regions.},

We meta-analyzed the strength of this relationship and clarified the impact of theoretically relevant moderators. Sixty-six studies collectively including more than 27,000 participants were located. We observed a significant positive relationship (r = .10; Zr = .10) between opinion climate and opinion expression. This relationship was not weaker in online as compared with offline opinion expression environments. Also, the relationship did not vary by the number of the targets of opinion expression, the opinion of the targets, the opinion climate characteristics, and the design, measurement, and sample characteristics. The largest silencing effect (r = .34), however, was observed when participants talk to their family, friends, or neighbors about obtrusive issues. Overall, our findings suggest that the relationship between opinion climate perception and political opinion expression is stronger and more robust than previously thought.},

  abstract = {Terrorism's efficacy, like beauty, is in the eyes of the beholder in that those who commit political violence deliberately directed against civilians believe in the success of their deeds. In one respect, most if not all terrorists do achieve an important goal. Whenever they strike, especially if they stage socalled terrorist spectaculars, their deeds assure them massive news coverage and the attention of the general public and governmental decision makers in their particular target societies. Moreover, given the global nature of the communication system, the perpetrators of international and domestic terrorism also tap into the international media and thereby receive the attention of publics and governments beyond their immediate target countries. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once said that publicity is the oxygen of terrorism. Without publicity, terrorism would be like the proverbial tree that falls in the forest and the press is not there to report-it would be as if the incident never happened. The term "mass-mediated terrorism" signifies the centrality of media considerations in the calculus of political violence that is committed by nonstate actors against civilians.' While publicity is not the ultimate objective, terrorists recognize that it is the means to advertise and further their larger political ends. This article examines whether and how the architects of the horrific events of September 11 succeeded in achieving their media goals.},

At the same time, resources that would identify these properties and investigate their influence and methods to handle them in machine learning applications are lagging behind. In this survey of the literature, we seek to identify and discuss spatial properties of data that influence the performance of machine learning. We review some of the best practices in handling such properties in spatial domains and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. We recognize two broad strands in this literature. In the first, the properties of spatial data are developed in the spatial observation matrix without amending the substance of the learning algorithm; in the other, spatial data properties are handled in the learning algorithm itself. While the latter have been far less explored, we argue that they offer the most promising prospects for the future of spatial machine learning.},

  abstract = {Over the last 30 years, trends such as service sector growth, welfare state expansion and rising female participation rates have promoted increasing heterogeneity within the occupational system. Accordingly, this article argues that the class map has to be redrawn in order to grasp these changes in the employment structure. For that purpose, it develops the bases of a new class schema that partly shifts its focus from hierarchical divisions to horizontal cleavages. The middle class is not conceptualized as a unitary grouping and the manual/non-manual divide is not used as a decisive class boundary. Instead, emphasis is put on differences in marketable skills and the work logic. The schema is expected to more accurately reflect the class location of unskilled service employees and to make visible the political divide within the salaried middle class. This expectation is empirically examined with survey data from Britain, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland. Findings for earnings and promotion prospects indicate that the schema successfully captures the hierarchical dimension in the class structure. Moreover, results for party support and union membership suggest that the schema grasps a salient horizontal cleavage between managers and sociocultural professionals.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, among others have been used as a tool for staging protests, opinion polls, campaign strategy, medium of agitation and a place of interest expression especially during elections. Past studies have established people’s opinion elections using social media posts. The advent of state-of-the-art algorithms for unstructured text processing implies tremendous progress in natural language processing and understanding. Aim: In this work, a Natural Language framework is designed to understand Nigeria 2023 presidential election based on public opinion using Twitter dataset. Methods: Raw datasets concerning discourse around Nigeria 2023 elections from Twitter of 2,059,113 𝜒𝜒 18 dimensions were collected. Sentiment analysis was performed on the preprocessed dataset using three different machine learning models namely: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and Linear Support Vector Classifier (LSVC) models. Personal tweet analysis of the three candidates provided insight on their campaign strategies and personalities while public tweet analysis established the public’s opinion about them. The performance of the models was also compared using accuracy, recall, false positive rate, precision and F-measure. Results: LSTM model gave an accuracy, precision, recall, AUC and f-measure of 88\%, 82.7\%, 87.2\% , 87.6\% and 82.9\% respectively; the BERT model gave an accuracy, precision, recall, AUC and f-measure of 94\%, 88.5\%, 92.5\%, 94.7\% and 91.7\% respectively while the LSVC model gave an accuracy, precision, recall, AUC and f-measure of 73\%, 81.4\%, 76.4\%, 81.2\% and 79.2\% respectively. Conclusion: The experimental results show that sentiment analysis and other Natural Language Processing tasks can aid in the understanding of the social media space. Results also revealed the leverage of each aspirant towards winning the election. We conclude that sentiment analysis can form a general basis for generating insights for election and modeling election outcomes.},

This unfortunate social circumstance has its roots in the process of colonization and is sustained, in part, by the belief that the Amazonian people and their territories are “savage” and need to be “civilized.” This belief forms part of a fundamentally racist ideological system, which attempts to justify the colonizing venture to which these villages are subjected. This racist ideology has a cultural base in the sense that it links “race” (the phenotype) with “culture” the latter understood as a collection of social factors, such as education, language, customs, occupation and place of origin.},

Analizamos su influencia en las políticas de reparaciones y sus repercusiones en las formas de identificación de las poblaciones andinas. El análisis del contenido del Informe final de la CVR y de las actividades realizadas en el memorial El Ojo que Llora de Lima pone de relieve el proceso de etnización de la categoría de víctima, como inocente e indígena. La escenificación de esta figura positiva de lo indígena buscó contrarrestar el estigma asociado al “indio”, considerado como terrorista durante la guerra. Sin embargo, esta postura no deja de transmitir cierto esencialismo sobre la “otredad” interior. En su afán de visibilizar y valorar elementos culturales “andinos”, ¿los activistas de derechos humanos no corren el riesgo de reproducir el exotismo asociado a las poblaciones más afectadas por la guerra que ellos mismos denuncian en su lucha contra el racismo? Del mismo modo, vincular las comunidades campesinas contemporáneas con el pasado prehispánico reduce la posibilidad de reconocer plenamente a esta población rural del país como actores dinámicos, con su propia subjetividad política. Dirigir el foco hacia la réplica del memorial limeño en una comunidad campesina andina nos permite vislumbrar también cómo se redefinen las relaciones entre centro y periferia, mediante la construcción local de la memoria colectiva del conflicto armado interno.},

This volume constitutes the first agent-based modeling textbook aimed at an archaeological audience. Its objectives are threefold: first, to provide lecturers with a ready-made but easily modifiable textbook for class teaching as the modules in digital archaeology become more ubiquitous and as the first generation of ABM modelers enter into lectureship positions; second, to provide archaeologists at any stage of education with a synthetic text for self-teaching; and third, to provide the community of ABM modelers with a reference publication that can be consulted when looking for a specific algorithm and its implementation or for previous ABM applications in a given research area"--},

  abstract = {With the current surge of simulation studies in archaeology, there is a growing concern for the lack of engagement and feedback between modelers and domain specialists. To facilitate this dialogue, I present a compact guide to the simulation modeling process applied to a common research topic and the focus of this special issue of Human Biology—human dispersals. The process of developing a simulation is divided into nine steps grouped in three phases. The conceptual phase consists of identifying research questions (step 1), fijinding the most suitable method (step 2), designing the general framework and the resolution of the simulation (step 3), and fijilling in that framework with the modeled entities and the rules of interactions (step 4). This is followed by the technical phase of coding and testing (step 5), parameterizing the simulation (step 6), and running it (step 7), and the results of the simulation are analyzed and recontextualized (step 8). In the dissemination phase, the fijindings of the model are disseminated in publications and code repositories (step 9). Each step is defijined and characterized and then illustrated with examples of published human dispersal simulation studies. While not aiming to be a comprehensive textbook-style guide to simulation, this overview of the process of modeling human dispersals should arm any nonmodeler with enough understanding to evaluate the quality, strengths, and weaknesses of any particular archaeological simulation and provide a starting point for further exploration of this common scientifijic tool.},

The aim of this paper is to analyze the distribution of alcohol consumption occurred within the main campus (CU) of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), in a period of four years, through the study of their spatial relationships. Based on Tobler’s First Law which explains that “everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant ones”, one can say that the distribution of alcohol consumption that extends into CU is determined by the spatial dependence of consumption areas, and spatial relationships that they have with their environment. To achieve this goal we used concepts of Geography of Crime, Spatial Dependency, Spatial Analysis and Modeling which through geographical information systems, provide a tool to help gain a better understanding of space and then integrate a solution study problem. The results of applying the model allowed determining possible areas of consumption within the study area, data that is important for the implementation of improved monitoring plans within the campus.},

Este estudio analiza la relación entre la ideología política y diversas manifestaciones de prejuicio en una muestra de habitantes de la ciudad de Lima (N = 199). Las variables estudiadas son: la Intolerancia a la Incertidumbre y la Ambigüedad, la Posición Izquierda/Derecha, el Autoritarismo de Ala Derecha (RWA), la Orientación hacia la Dominancia Social (SDO), la Homofobia, el Sexismo Ambivalente y el Prejuicio hacia minorías étnicas amazónicas. Dos modelos de ecuaciones estructurales fueron propuestos. Uno de ellos presentó un mejor grado de ajuste y propone que la Intolerancia a la Incertidumbre y la Ambigüedad influyen sobre el RWA y la SDO. Asimismo, RWA y SDO influyen sobre las diversas expresiones de prejuicio. Sin embargo, el RWA en contraste con la SDO, presenta una mejor capacidad predictiva con respecto a las diversas formas de prejuicio. La discusión final propone que en el Perú es razonable utilizar un enfoque ideológico multidimensional, así como la propuesta del conservadurismo como cognición social motivada para comprender el prejuicio y la estereotipia negativa hacia grupos percibidos como amenazantes o de bajo estatus. Individuos con mayor tendencia hacia el autoritarismo de derecha y el conservadurismo, tenderían a percibir a estos grupos como amenazas hacia el orden social tradicionalmente establecido.

Dois modelos de equações estruturais foram propostos. Um deles apresentou um melhor grau de ajuste e propõe que a Intolerância à Incerteza e a Ambiguidade influem sobre o RWA e a SDO.

  abstract = {An irreverent, provocative, and visually fascinating look at what our online lives reveal about who we really are--and how this deluge of data will transform the science of human behavior. Big Data is used to spy on us, hire and fire us, and sell us things we don't need. In Dataclysm, Christian Rudder puts this flood of information to an entirely different use: understanding human nature. Drawing on terabytes of data from Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, OkCupid, and many other sites, Rudder examines the terrain of human experience. He charts the rise and fall of America's most reviled word through Google Search, examines the new dynamics of collaborative rage on Twitter, and traces human migration over time, showing how groups of people move from certain small towns to the same big cities across the globe. And he grapples with the challenge of maintaining privacy in a world where these explorations are possible. Audacious, entertaining, and illuminating, Dataclysm is a portrait of our essential selves--and a first look at a revolution in the making. --},

  abstract = {Findings derived from self-reported, structured survey questionnaires are commonly used in evaluation and applied research to inform policy-making and program decisions. Although there are a variety of issues related to the quality of survey evidence (e.g., sampling precision), the validity of response processes–how respondents process thoughts and perceptions when answering questionnaires–is crucial. We assess the extent to which cognitive interviews, used to test survey questions as part of the process of questionnaire design and refinement, can strengthen the quality of survey evidence for small- and medium-scale evaluations. To illustrate how cognitive interviews can reveal respondents' response processes and improved questionnaire interpretations, we present excerpts from two types of evaluations (e.g., needs assessment) in two domains (e.g., education). The paper concludes with a brief summary about how the use of cognitive interviews can be augmented in survey development, refinement, and adaptation to improve survey questionnaire interpretations in evaluations with limited resources.},

In this paper, we further develop a sampling and estimation technique called respondent-driven sampling, which allows researchers to make asymptotically unbiased estimates about these hidden populations. The sample is selected with a snowball-type design that can be done more cheaply, quickly, and easily than other methods currently in use. Further, we can show that under certain specified (and quite general) conditions, our estimates for the percentage of the population with a specific trait are asymptotically unbiased. We further show that these estimates are asymptotically unbiased no matter how the seeds are selected. We conclude with a comparison of respondent-driven samples of jazz musicians in New York and San Francisco, with corresponding institutional samples of jazz musicians from these cities. The results show that some standard methods for studying hidden populations can produce misleading results.},

Scholars have focused on factors that explain the lack of inter-ethnic cooperation, such as prejudice or the difficulty to communicate and sanction across group boundaries. We direct attention to the fact that diverse communities are also often poor and ask whether poverty, rather than diversity, reduces cooperation. We developed a strategic cooperation game where we vary the income and racial identity of the interaction partner. We find that beliefs about how poor people behave have clear detrimental effects on cooperation: cooperation is lower when people are paired with low-income partners, and the effect is particularly strong when low-income people interact among themselves. We observe additional discrimination along racial lines when the interaction partner is poor. These findings imply that poverty and rising inequality may be a serious threat to social cohesion, especially under conditions of high socioeconomic segregation.},

  abstract = {While online social media offers a way for ignored or stifled voices to be heard, it also allows users a platform to spread hateful speech. Such speech usually originates in fringe communities, yet it can spill over into mainstream channels. In this paper, we measure the impact of joining fringe hateful communities in terms of hate speech propagated to the rest of the social network. We leverage data from Reddit to assess the effect of joining one type of echo chamber: a digital community of likeminded users exhibiting hateful behavior. We measure members’ usage of hate speech outside the studied community before and after they become active participants. Using Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis as a causal inference method, we gauge the spillover effect, in which hateful language from within a certain community can spread outside that community by using the level of out-of-community hate word usage as a proxy for learned hate. We investigate four different Reddit subcommunities (subreddits) covering three areas of hate speech: racism, misogyny and fat-shaming. In all three cases we find an increase in hate speech outside the originating community, implying that joining such community leads to a spread of hate speech throughout the platform. Moreover, users are found to pick up this new hateful speech for months after initially joining the community. We show that the harmful speech does not remain contained within the community. Our results provide new evidence of the harmful effects of echo chambers and the potential benefit of moderating them to reduce adoption of hateful speech.},

This approach has come to be known as behavioral economics. How can economists effectively capture the effects of psychology and its influence on economic events and change? Shiller attempts to help us better understand how psychology affects events by explaining how popular economic stories arise, how they grow viral, and ultimately how they drive economic developments. After defining narrative economics in the book's preface with allusions to the advent of both the Great Depression and to World War II, Shiller presents an example of a recent economic narrative gone viral in the story of Bitcoin. Next, he explains how narrative economics works with reference to how other disciplines incorporate narrative into their analyses and also to how epidemiology explains how disease goes viral. He then presents accounts of recurring economic narratives, including the gold standard, real estate booms, war and depression, and stock market booms and crashes. He ends his book with a blueprint for future research by economists on narrative economics"--},

Does violent entertainment increase the rate of violent crime? Do parents treat sons differently from daughters? How many people actually read the books they buy? In this work, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, a Harvard-trained economist, former Google data scientist, and New York Times writer, argues that much of what we thought about people has been dead wrong. The reason? People lie, to friends, lovers, doctors, surveys -- and themselves. However, we no longer need to rely on what people tell us. New data from the internet -- the traces of information that billions of people leave on Google, social media, dating, and even pornography sites -- finally reveals the truth. By analyzing this digital goldmine, we can now learn what people really think, what they really want, and what they really do. Sometimes the new data will make you laugh out loud. Sometimes the new data will shock you. Sometimes the new data will deeply disturb you. But, always, this new data will make you think.--},

Western countries such as Australia, UK, and USA have invested a great amount of financial resources to combat global terrorism yet there is a concern the investments outweigh the risk. Furthermore, there are some people who question the reality of global terrorism. To explore these issues, this study analyzes the global terrorism empirical evidence from 1970 to 2013 (2014 was still in progress). The goal was to describe the global terrorist behavior factors and patterns from a socio-economical perspective, to identify who the terrorist groups are, what they do, and where they attack. Interesting descriptive statistics and insights were provided to help practitioners understand how global terrorism impacts us and to motive more empirical into this important topic.},

Sus muertes precipitaron la renuncia de Manuel Merino a la Presidencia de la República, el domingo pasado, y han conmovido a todo el país, que se ha solidarizado con los familiares de los jóvenes. La necropsia de los cuerpos ha confirmado que ambos manifestantes perdieron la vida por graves heridas causadas por impactos de armas de fuego.~ Bryan Pintado recibió 11 disparos de perdigones que dañaron su cráneo, cara, cuello, brazos y tórax. En el caso de Inti Sotelo, se halló cuatro impactos de perdigones cerca al corazón, que habrían ocasionado su muerte.~ ~ Al respecto, el Ministerio Público ha iniciado dos investigaciones preliminares: una al expresidente Manuel Merino, al expremier Ántero Flores-Aráoz y al exministro del Interior, Gastón Rodriguez, por el delito de homicidio culposo; y otra, contra los que resulten responsables, por homicidio en el contexto de graves violaciones de derechos humanos. En este pódcast de Convoca~Radio, conoce a los llamados “héroes del bicentenario”, cuyas muertes contribuyeron al retorno del país al cauce de la democracia, la cual fue interrumpida por 105 congresistas que destituyeron de la presidencia a Martín Vizcarra y, así, colocaron a Manuel Merino como jefe de Estado.

Scholars continue to disagree, however, about the specific motives that drive belligerents to target civilians or the conditions under which large-scale violence against civilians is most likely.},

  abstract = {The goal of this book is to put an array of tools at the fingertips of students, practitioners, and researchers by explaining approaches long used by survey statisticians, illustrating how existing software can be used to solve survey problems, and developing some specialized software where needed. This volume serves at least three audiences: (1) students of applied sampling techniques; 2) practicing survey statisticians applying concepts learned in theoretical or applied sampling courses; and (3) social scientists and other survey practitioners who design, select, and weight survey samples. The text thoroughly covers fundamental aspects of survey sampling, such as sample size calculation (with examples for both single- and multi-stage sample design) and weight computation, accompanied by software examples to facilitate implementation. Features include step-by-step instructions for calculating survey weights, extensive real-world examples and applications, and representative programming code in R, SAS, and other packages. Since the publication of the first edition in 2013, there have been important developments in making inferences from nonprobability samples, in address-based sampling (ABS), and in the application of machine learning techniques for survey estimation. New to this revised and expanded edition: • Details on new functions in the PracTools package • Additional machine learning methods to form weighting classes • New coverage of nonlinear optimization algorithms for sample allocation • Reflecting effects of multiple weighting steps (nonresponse and calibration) on standard errors • A new chapter on nonprobability sampling • Additional examples, exercises, and updated references throughout Richard Valliant, PhD, is Research Professor Emeritus at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan and at the Joint Program in Survey Methodology at the University of Maryland.

  abstract = {Social scientists usually assume that the attitudes, behaviors, and statuses of respondents to longitudinal surveys are not altered by the act of measuring them. If this assumption is false—or even if the quality of survey participants’ responses change because of measurement—then social scientists risk mischaracterizing the existence, magnitude, and correlates of changes across survey waves in respondents’ characteristics. In this article, we make the case that social scientists ought to worry more about panel conditioning biases. We also describe and demonstrate empirical strategies for estimating the magnitude of such biases in longitudinal surveys, and we provide illustrative empirical results that are germane to social science research. We end by outlining a research agenda that would generate specific information about the nature and degree of panel conditioning in specific longitudinal surveys as well as a broader understanding of the circumstances in which panel conditioning is most likely to occur.},

  abstract = {Tobler's first law (TFL) of geography was introduced into the geographical literature in an article that Waldo Tobler published in the journal Economic Geography in 1970. In this article, which described a simulation of population growth in Detroit, Tobler stated that to make his model operational he would “invoke the first law of geography: everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things.” This entry considers whether TFL is an accurate description of the real world. Specifically, it considers the following questions: Is TFL really a law and, if so, is it the most important law in Geography? Do modern spatial interpolation techniques allow the model to be operationalized? How can “near” and “distant” be measured? Is it true for Euclidean and network space? Do classic models of human and urban geography conform to TFL?}

Parallel models are estimated using Equifax credit bureau data and Survey of Consumer Finances data. After adjustments to account for different variable definitions and sampled populations, it is possible to arrive at similar models of total household debt. However, the estimates are sensitive to the adjustments. In this example, some external education and income measures are successfully integrated with the big data, but other external aggregates fail to adequately substitute for survey responses.},

  abstract = {Random-digit dialing (RDD) telephone surveys are challenged by declining response rates and increasing costs. Many surveys that were traditionally conducted via telephone are seeking cost-effective alternatives, such as address-based sampling (ABS) with self-administered web or mail questionnaires. At a fraction of the cost of both telephone and ABS surveys, opt-in web panels are an attractive alternative. The 2019–2020 National Alcohol Survey (NAS) employed three methods: (1) an RDD telephone survey (traditional NAS method); (2) an ABS push-to-web survey; and (3) an opt-in web panel. The study reported here evaluated differences in the three data-collection methods, which we will refer to as “mode effects,” on alcohol consumption and health topics. To evaluate mode effects, multivariate regression models were developed predicting these characteristics, and the presence of a mode effect on each outcome was determined by the significance of the three-level effect (RDD-telephone, ABS-web, opt-in web panel) in each model. Those results were then used to adjust for mode effects and produce a “telephone-equivalent” estimate for the ABS and panel data sources. The study found that ABS-web and RDD were similar for most estimates but exhibited differences for sensitive questions including getting drunk and experiencing depression. The opt-in web panel exhibited more differences between it and the other two survey modes. One notable example is the reporting of drinking alcohol at least 3–4 times per week, which was 21 percent for RDD-phone, 24 percent for ABS-web, and 34 percent for opt-in web panel. The regression model adjusts for mode effects, improving comparability with past surveys conducted by telephone; however, the models result in higher variance of the estimates. This method of adjusting for mode effects has broad applications to mode and sample transitions throughout the survey research industry.},
